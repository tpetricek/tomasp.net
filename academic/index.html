      <h2 class="first">Journal and conference publications</h2>
      <p>The following papers have been published in recognized top-tier programming language
        conferences and in journals and present my most important results. Further workshop
        publications and abstracts, many of which are highly-cited, are listed below.</p>

      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/schema/">Schema Evolution in Interactive Programming Systems</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Jonathan Edwards, Tomas Petricek, Tijs van der Storm, Geoffrey Litt. The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2024</p>
        <p> Many improvements to programming came from tighter feedback loops, but making a
program change that involves changing the schema (or type) of program is difficult -- you
have to manually update code and data to match the new schema. We present an analysis of the
problem of schema change in programming and a number of diverse challenge problems to
inspire research on the problem.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/ai-assistants/">AI Assistants: A Framework for Semi-Automated Data Wrangling</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Gerrit J J van den Burg, Alfredo Nazábal, Taha Ceritli, Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz, Christopher K I Williams. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 2023</p>
        <p> Despite the rise of  artificial intelligence, data wrangling
remains a tedious and manual task. We introduce AI assistants, semi-automatic
interactive tools to streamline data wrangling. An AI assistant guides the analyst through a
specific data wrangling task and recommends suitable data transformation, respecting constraints
obtained through interaction with the expert.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/techdims/">Technical Dimensions of Programming Systems</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Joel Jakubovic, Jonathan Edwards, Tomas Petricek. The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2023</p>
        <p>  We know how to study programming languages, but how to study stateful, interactive and
graphical programming systems? This paper presents a qualitative framework for thinking and talking about programming systems.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/self-sustainability/">Ascending the Ladder to Self-Sustainability: Achieving Open Evolution in an Interactive Graphical System</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Joel Jakubovic, Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of Onward! Essays 2022</p>
        <p>
Self-sustaining systems expose their implementation and can be modified and improved from
within. However, the few examples that exist are tightly linked to textual language-based
accounts of compiler bootstrapping. We explore how the bootstrapping process can work in
more structured, visual programming environments.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/iterative/">The Gamma: Programmatic Data Exploration for Non-programmers</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of VL/HCC 2022.</p>
        <p> Data exploration tools based on code can access any data source, result in reproducible scripts and encourage users
to verify, reuse and modify existing code, but can we make them accessible to non-experts? The Gamma is a novel text-based
data exploration tool that answers the question in the affirmative.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/linkedviz/">Linked Visualisations via Galois Dependencies</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Roly Perera, Minh Nguyen, Tomas Petricek and Meng Wang. In Proceedings of POPL 2022</p>
        <p> We present new language-based dynamic analysis techniques for linking
visualisations to data in a fine-grained way, allowing a user to interactively explore how
data attributes map to visual or other output elements by selecting substructures of interest.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/covid-data/">Covid-19, Charitable Giving and Collectivism: a data-harvesting approach</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Peter Taylor-Gooby, Tomas Petricek and Jack Cunliffe. Journal of Social Policy, 2021</p>
        <p> This paper charts responses to urgent appeals by welfare charities through crowd
funding websites  in order to examine the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on public generosity
and social cohesion in the UK.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/">Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of Onward! Essays 2021</p>
        <p> In this essay, I draw a parallel
between the world of software and the world of architecture, design and urban planning. I hope to
convince the reader that this is a well-justified parallel and I point to a number of discussions
in architecture, design and urban planning from which the software world could learn.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/compost/">Composable data visualizations</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. Journal of Functional Programming, 2021</p>
        <p> Compost is a data visualization library that lets you compose rich interactive data
visualizations from a small number of basic primitives. The library is based on the
functional programming idea of composable domain-specific languages. This functional
programming pearl is a tutorial that introduces Compost through a wide range of examples.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/monads/">What we talk about when we talk about monads</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2018</p>
        <p> Computer science provides an in-depth understanding of technical
aspects of programming concepts, but if we want to understand how programming concepts evolve,
how programmers think about them and how they are used in practice, we need to consider a
broader perspective. This paper explains how computer scientists and programmers talk about
monads and why they do so.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/pivot/">Data exploration through dot-driven development</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In proceedings of ECOOP 2017.</p>
        <p> Data literacy is becoming increasingly important. While spreadsheets make
simple data analytics accessible to a large number of people, creating transparent scripts
requires expert programming skills. In this paper, we describe the design of a data
exploration language that makes the task more accessible by embedding advanced programming
concepts into a simple core language.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/failures/">Miscomputation in software: Learning to live with errors</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2017</p>
        <p>  Computer programs do not always work as expected. In fact, ominous warnings about
the desperate state of the software industry continue to be released with almost ritualistic
regularity. In this paper, we look at the 60 years history of programming and at the different
practical methods that software community developed to live with programming errors.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/fsharp-data/">Types from data: Making structured data first-class citizens in F#</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Gustavo Guerra and Don Syme. In Proceedings of PLDI 2016</p>
        <p>  The paper presents <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data">F# Data</a>, a library of type providers
that integrate external data in XML, CSV and JSON formats into the type system of the F# language.
F# Data infers the shape of structured documents and uses it to guarantee a relative safety property.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/effects-revisited/">Effect systems revisited - control-flow algebra and semantics</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Alan Mycroft, Dominic Orchard, Tomas Petricek.<br /> Semantics, Logics, and Calculi, 2016</p>
        <p>  This paper joins two recent developments related to effect systems - the development of richer
effect systems based on complex algebraic structures and the development of semantic models based
on monads. We show how <em>graded joinads</em> link the two developments.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/against-types/">Against a Universal Definition of 'Type'</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of Onward! Essays 2015</p>
        <p><em>What is the definition of type?</em> Having a clear and precise answer to this question would
avoid many misunderstandings but it would hurt science, "hamper the growth of knowledge" and
"deflect the course of investigation into narrow channels of things already understood".</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/structural/">Coeffects: A calculus of context-dependent computation</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Dominic Orchard and Alan Mycroft. In Proceedings of ICFP 2014</p>
        <p>  We present a general calculus for tracking contextual properties of computations,
including per-variable properties (usage patterns, caching requirements) and
whole-context properties (platform version, rebindable resources). This resolves
questions that were left unanswered in the ICALP 2013 paper below.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/coeffects/">Coeffects: Unified static analysis of context-dependence</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Dominic Orchard and Alan Mycroft. In Proceedings of ICALP 2013.</p>
        <p>  Effects capture how computations <em>affect</em> the environment, coeffects capture the
<em>requirements</em> that computations place on the environment. We present a unified
coeffect system that can be used for checking liveness and properties of
data-flow or distributed programs,</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      

      <h2>Recent workshop papers</h2>
      <p>The following papers cover a wide range of topics from data journalism, theory and practice
        of programming to philosophy and history of compter science. They appeared in workshop and
        conference proceedings, but many have been highly influential.</p>

      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/mixed-initiative-proofs/">Don't Call Us, We'll Call You: Towards Mixed-Initiative Inte&shy;ractive Proof Assistants for Programming Language Theory</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Jan Liam Verter and Tomas Petricek. Human Aspects of Types and Reasoning Assistants, 2024</p>
        <p> When constructing a proof about programming language theory, one typically states
the property and then develops the proof manually, until an automatic strategy can fill the
remaining gaps. We propose a mixed-initiative proof assistant where the tool starts with a
an automatic search, but seeks feedback from the user when needed.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/schema-challenges/">Live &amp; Local Schema Change: Challenge Problems</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Jonathan Edwards, Tomas Petricek, Tijs van der Storm. Presented at LIVE 2023</p>
        <p> Schema change is an unsolved problem in both live programming and local-first
software. It can create a mismatch between the code and data in the running environment and
mismatches between data in different replicas. We contribute a set of challenges involving
schema change, offered to the live and local-first communities.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/copy-paste/">Interaction vs. Abstraction: Managed Copy and Paste</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Jonathan Edwards, Tomas Petricek. Proceedings of PAINT 2022</p>
        <p> Inspired by version control systems like git, we
propose managed copy &amp; paste, in which the programming environment records copy &amp; paste operations,
along with structural edit operations, so that it can track the differences between copies and
reconcile them on command.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/drafts/complementary/">Complementary science of interactive programming systems</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Joel Jakubovic. Presented at HaPoC 2021</p>
        <p> Is it worth looking at the history of programming in order to discover lost
ideas that could be utilized by present-day computer scientists? This paper argues that this
is the case and presents an early experiment that recovers a number of interesting programming
ideas from, against all odds, Commodore 64 BASIC.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/typed-image/">Typed Image-based Programming with Structure Editing</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Jonathan Edwards and Tomas Petricek. Human Aspects of Types and Reasoning Assistants, 2021</p>
        <p> Many beloved programming system like Smalltalk and LISP are image-based.
This encourages exploration and allows flexibility, but it makes collaboration hard.
We tackle the problem of schema change in image-based programming systems using static types.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/hopl-iv/">Report on HOPL IV - ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming Languages Conference</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Mark Priestley, and Tomas Petricek and David Hemmendinger, IEEE Ann. Hist. Comput. vol 43, no 3</p>
        <p> Report on HOPL IV, the latest in the ACM's occasional series of
conferences on the history of programming languages that took place on June 20–22,
2021, in association with PLDI 2021.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/live/">Foundations of a live data exploration environment</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020</p>
        <p> The way data analysts write code is different from the way software engineers do so.
They use few abstractions, work interactively and rely heavily on external libraries.
We capture this way of working and build a programming environment that makes data exploration
easier by providing instant live feedback.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/evaluating-systems/">Evaluating programming systems design</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Jonathan Edwards, Stephen Kell, Tomas Petricek, Luke Church. Proceedings of PPIG 2019</p>
        <p> Research on programming systems design needs to consider a wide range of aspects in
their full complexity. In this paper, we ask whether new media such as multimedia essays can
serve as publication formats, more suitable for evaluating programming systems design.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/funding-stories/">Stories of storytelling about UK’s EU funding</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Mariana Marasoiu et al. Proceedings of European Data and Computational Journalism Conference, 2018</p>
        <p>  We explore the difficulties of open data analysis using the data available
on EU funding to the UK. We report on some of the fundamental difficulties we observed whilst
analysing this data and we suggest ways of addressing such difficulties.</p>

        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. Presented at HaPoC 2023</p>
        <p> The term extensible programming language is not something that would be familiar
to programmers and computer scientists today. Yet, in the1960s and 1970s, extensible
programming languages were a household name. What were extensible programming languages,

        <p> This paper documents the socio-technological context that shapes programming languages.
To structure our discussion, we introduce the idea of a culture of programming which embodies
a particular perspective on programming. We identify four major cultures: hacker culture,
engineering culture, managerial culture and mathematical culture.</p>

        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, James Geddes, Charles Sutton. In Proceedings of TaPP 2018</p>
        <p> Notebook systems such as Jupyter are a popular environment for data science,
but they use an architecture that leads to a limited model of interaction and makes
versioning and reproducibility difficult. Wrattler revisits the architecture and allows
richer forms of interactivity, efficient evaluation and guaranteed reproducibility.</p>

        <p>  The idea of interaction is not just another programming abstraction, but different
way of structuring our thinking about programming. This includes thinking about how users can
interact with the software more generally, but also what are effective metaphorical ways of
thinking about software.</p>

        <p>  The rise of open data initiatives means that there is an increasing amount of raw

        <p> This paper leverages recent advances in Haskell's type system

        <p>  When translating pure functional code to a monadic version, we need to use different translation depending

        <p>  The paper introduces a <code>docase</code> notation for Haskell that can be used for any monad that
