      <h2 class="first">Journal and conference publications</h2>
      <p>The following papers have been published in recognized top-tier programming language
        conferences and in journals and present my most important results. Further workshop
        publications and abstracts, many of which are highly-cited, are listed below.</p>

      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/live/">Foundations of a live data exploration environment</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020</p>
        <p> The way data analysts write code is different from the way software engineers do so.
They use few abstractions, work interactively and rely heavily on external libraries.
We capture this way of working and build a programming environment that makes data exploration
easier by providing instant live feedback.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/monads/">What we talk about when we talk about monads</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2018</p>
        <p> Computer science provides an in-depth understanding of technical
aspects of programming concepts, but if we want to understand how programming concepts evolve,
how programmers think about them and how they are used in practice, we need to consider a
broader perspective. This paper explains how computer scientists and programmers talk about
monads and why they do so.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/pivot/">Data exploration through dot-driven development</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In proceedings of ECOOP 2017.</p>
        <p> Data literacy is becoming increasingly important. While spreadsheets make
simple data analytics accessible to a large number of people, creating transparent scripts
requires expert programming skills. In this paper, we describe the design of a data
exploration language that makes the task more accessible by embedding advanced programming
concepts into a simple core language.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/failures/">Miscomputation in software: Learning to live with errors</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2017</p>
        <p>  Computer programs do not always work as expected. In fact, ominous warnings about 
the desperate state of the software industry continue to be released with almost ritualistic
regularity. In this paper, we look at the 60 years history of programming and at the different
practical methods that software community developed to live with programming errors.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/fsharp-data/">Types from data: Making structured data first-class citizens in F#</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Gustavo Guerra and Don Syme. In Proceedings of PLDI 2016</p>
        <p>  The paper presents <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data">F# Data</a>, a library of type providers
that integrate external data in XML, CSV and JSON formats into the type system of the F# language.
F# Data infers the shape of structured documents and uses it to guarantee a relative safety property.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/effects-revisited/">Effect systems revisited - control-flow algebra and semantics</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Alan Mycroft, Dominic Orchard, Tomas Petricek.<br /> Semantics, Logics, and Calculi, 2016</p>
        <p>  This paper joins two recent developments related to effect systems - the development of richer
effect systems based on complex algebraic structures and the development of semantic models based
on monads. We show how <em>graded joinads</em> link the two developments.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/against-types/">Against a Universal Definition of 'Type'</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of Onward! Essays 2015</p>
        <p><em>What is the definition of type?</em> Having a clear and precise answer to this question would
avoid many misunderstandings but it would hurt science, "hamper the growth of knowledge" and
"deflect the course of investigation into narrow channels of things already understood".</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/structural/">Coeffects: A calculus of context-dependent computation</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Dominic Orchard and Alan Mycroft. In Proceedings of ICFP 2014</p>
        <p>  We present a general calculus for tracking contextual properties of computations,
including per-variable properties (usage patterns, caching requirements) and
whole-context properties (platform version, rebindable resources). This resolves
questions that were left unanswered in the ICALP 2013 paper below.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/coeffects/">Coeffects: Unified static analysis of context-dependence</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Dominic Orchard and Alan Mycroft. In Proceedings of ICALP 2013.</p>
        <p>  Effects capture how computations <em>affect</em> the environment, coeffects capture the
<em>requirements</em> that computations place on the environment. We present a unified
coeffect system that can be used for checking liveness and properties of
data-flow or distributed programs,</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
            

      <h2>Recent workshop papers</h2>
      <p>The following papers cover a wide range of topics from data journalism, theory and practice
        of programming to philosophy and history of compter science. They appeared in workshop and
        conference proceedings, but many have been highly influential.</p>

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/evaluating-systems/">Evaluating programming systems design</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Jonathan Edwards, Stephen Kell, Tomas Petricek, Luke Church. Proceedings of PPIG 2019</p>
        <p> Research on programming systems design needs to consider a wide range of aspects in
their full complexity. In this paper, we ask whether new media such as multimedia essays can
serve as publication formats, more suitable for evaluating programming systems design.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/funding-stories/">Stories of storytelling about UK’s EU funding</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Mariana Marasoiu et al. Proceedings of European Data and Computational Journalism Conference, 2018</p>
        <p>  We explore the difficulties of open data analysis using the data available
on EU funding to the UK. We report on some of the fundamental difficulties we observed whilst
analysing this data and we suggest ways of addressing such difficulties.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/you-guessed-it/">You guessed it! Reflecting on preconceptions and exploring data without statistics</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Pablo León-Villagrá et al. Proceedings of European Data and Computational Journalism Conference, 2018</p>
        <p>  We live in times in which information is abundant, but trust in expert analysis is low. How can we
make complex issues accessible for readers and overcome their preconceptions? We propose a novel
way of presenting readers with data and raising awareness for individual bias and preconceptions.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/wrattler/">Wrattler: Reproducible, live and polyglot notebooks</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, James Geddes, Charles Sutton. In Proceedings of TaPP 2018</p>
        <p> Notebook systems such as Jupyter are a popular environment for data science,
but they use an architecture that leads to a limited model of interaction and makes
versioning and reproducibility difficult. Wrattler revisits the architecture and allows
richer forms of interactivity, efficient evaluation and guaranteed reproducibility.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/anatomy-critique/">Critique of 'An anatomy of interaction: co-occurrences and entanglements'</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. Proceedings of Salon des Refusés, 2018</p>
        <p>  The idea of interaction is not just another programming abstraction, but different
way of structuring our thinking about programming. This includes thinking about how users can
interact with the software more generally, but also what are effective metaphorical ways of
thinking about software.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/storytelling/">The Gamma: Programming tools for open data-driven storytelling</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. Proceedings of European Data and Computational Journalism Conference, 2017</p>
        <p>  The rise of open data initiatives means that there is an increasing amount of raw
data available. At the same time, the general public increasingly distrusts statistics and
post-truth has been chosen as the word of 2016. The Gamma project aims to help reverse this development.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/drafts/unthinkable/">Programming language theory: Thinking the unthinkable</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. Presented at PPIG 2016.</p>
        <p> Our thinking is shaped by basic assumptions that we rarely question. 
What are some of the hidden assumptions that we never question and that
determine how programming languages are designed? And what might the world of programming
look like if we based our thinking on different basic principles?</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/age-of-web/">In the Age of Web: Typed Functional-First Programming Revisited</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Don Syme. In Post-proceedings of ML 2014</p>
        <p> Most programming languages were designed before the age of web. This matters because the web
changes many assumptions that typed functional language designers take for granted.
In this paper, we present how F# language and libraries face the challenges posed by the web.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/haskell-effects/">Embedding effect systems in Haskell</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Dominic Orchard, Tomas Petricek. Haskell 2014</p>
        <p> This paper leverages recent advances in Haskell's type system
to embed fine-grained monadic computations in Haskell, providing
user-programmable effect systems. We explore a number of practical
examples that make Haskell even better and safer for effectful
programming.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/drafts/iterative/">The Gamma: Data Exploration through Iterative Prompting</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. Unpublished draft.</p>
        <p> This paper presents The Gamma, a data exploration environment for non-experts,
based on a single interaction principle. The Gamma allows transfer of knowledge from one
data source to another and learning from previously created data analyses.
Our approach allows journalists and the public to benefit from the rise
of open data, by making data exploration easier, more transparent and more reproducible.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/drafts/cultures/">Cultures of programming: Understanding the history of programming through controversies and technical artifacts</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. Unpublished draft.</p>
        <p> This paper documents the socio-technological context that shapes programming languages.
To structure our discussion, we introduce the idea of a culture of programming which embodies
a particular perspective on programming. We identify four major cultures: hacker culture,
engineering culture, managerial culture and mathematical culture.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      

      <h2>Older workshop papers</h2>
      <p>The following papers cover a wide range of topics from data journalism, theory and practice
        of programming to philosophy and history of compter science. They appeared in workshop and
        conference proceedings, but many have been highly influential.</p>

      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/philosophy-pl/">What can Programming Language Research Learn from the Philosophy of Science?</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of AISB 2014</p>
        <p>  This essay looks how theories from philosophy of science apply
to programming language research. I argue that it is important to clearly state research
programme, avoid early over-emphasis on precision and I consider how to produce truly reusable
experiments.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/computation-zoo/">The F# Computation Expression Zoo</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek and Don Syme. In Proceedings of PADL 2014.</p>
        <p>  F# computation expressions F# provide a <em>uniform</em> syntax for computations such as
monads, monad transformers and applicative functors. The syntax is <em>adaptable</em> and
close to built-in language features of Python and C#. This article provides the details
shows that the right syntax can often be determined by considering laws.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/inforich/">Themes in Information-Rich Functional Programming for Internet-Scale Data Sources</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Don Syme, Keith Battocchi, Kenji Takeda, Donna Malayeri and Tomas Petricek. DDFP 2013</p>
        <p> In this position paper we describe the key themes in information-rich functional programming 
that we have observed during the work on F# 3.0 type providers.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/malias/">Evaluation strategies for monadic computations</h1></a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of MSFP 2012.</p>
        <p>  When translating pure functional code to a monadic version, we need to use different translation depending
on the desired evaluation strategy. In this paper, we present an unified translation that is parameterized by
an operation <code>malias</code>. We also show how to give <em>call-by-need</em> translation for certain
monads.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/docase/">Extending monads with pattern matching</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek, Alan Mycroft and Don Syme. In Haskell Symposium 2011.</p>
        <p>  The paper introduces a <code>docase</code> notation for Haskell that can be used for any monad that
provides additional operations representing parallel composition, choice and aliasing. We require the
operations to form a near-semiring, which gurantees that the notation resembles pattern matching.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/joinads/">Joinads: a retargetable control-flow construct for reactive, parallel and concurrent programming</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek and Don Syme. In Proceedings of PADL 2011.</p>
        <p>   Reactive, parallel and concurrent programming models are often difficult to encode in
general-purpose programming languages. We present a lightweight language extension based on
pattern matching that can be used for encoding a wide range of these models.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/async/">The F# Asynchronous Programming Model</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Don Syme, Tomas Petricek and Dmitry Lomov. In PADL 2011.</p>
        <p> We describe the asynchronous programming model in F#, and its applications. It combines a core
language with a non-blocking modality to author lightweight asynchronous tasks. This allows smooth
transitions between synchronous and asynchronous code and eliminates the inversion of control.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/hollywood/">Collecting Hollywood's Garbage: Avoiding Space-Leaks in Composite Events</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek and Don Syme. In Proceedings of ISMM 2010.</p>
        <p>  The article discusses memory leaks that can occur in a reactive programming model based on events.
It presents a formal garbage collection algorithm that could be used in this scenario and a
correct reactive library based on this idea, implemented in F#.</p>
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/iterators/">Encoding monadic computations in C# using iterators</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of ITAT 2009</p>
        <p> The paper shows how to encode certain monadic computations (such as a continuation monad
for asynchronus programming) using the iterator language feature in C# 2.0.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      

      <h2>Theses and older projects</h2>
      <p>Here you'll find my PhD thesis on from University of Cambridge as well as Bachelor and Master

        first functional-language to JavaScript translators.</p>

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/theses/coeffects/">Context-aware programming languages (PhD thesis)</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. University of Cambridge, 2017</p>
        <p> The key point made by this thesis is the realization that an execution environment or a context is
fundamental for writing modern applications and that programming languages should provide abstractions
for programming with context and verifying how it is accessed. The thesis summarizes all my work on
coeffects.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/theses/events/">Reactive Programming with Events (Master thesis)</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Master thesis. Charles University in Prague, 2010</p>
        <p> The thesis uses early version of joinad language extension for F# and garbage collection
for events. Based on these concepts, it builds a simple reactive library for F# that allows
writing reactive computations in both control-flow and data-flow styles.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/theses/webtools/">Client-side Scripting using Meta-programming (Bachelor thesis)</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Bachelor thesis. Charles University in Prague, 2007</p>
        <p>  The thesis presents a web development framework for F# that automatically splits a single F#
program with monadic modality annotations into client-side JavaScript and server-side ASP.NET
application.</p>
      
      
      
      

      <h2>Notes, articles and reports</h2>
      <p>I wrote a couple of articles, notes and reports that were never formally published,
        but might still be of interest. This includes my work on compiling F# to JavaScript
        and notes on teaching functional programming.</p>

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/drafts/fsharp-teaching/">Teaching Functional Programming to Professional .NET Developers</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. In Pre-proceedings of TFPIE 2012.</p>
        <p> Functional programming is often taught at universities, but with the recent rise of functional
programming in the industry, it is becoming important to teach functional concepts to experienced
developers. This requires a very different approach.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
        <h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/theses/first-year/">Effect and coeffect type systems (First-year PhD report)</a></h3>
        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. First year report, Computer Laboratory.</p>
        <p>  The research goal discussed in the report is to use types in an ML-style language to track
additional properties of computations including various kinds of effects (communication, memory access)
and coeffects (how a computation depends on a context). The document briefly summarizes the work
done during the first-year (including the work on <em>joinads</em> and <em>coeffects</em>) and
it proposes future research projects.</p>

        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. The Monad.Reader Issue 18.</p>
        <p>  The article presents several monads that can benefit from the <em>parallel monad comprehension</em>
notation that is supported in the re-designed monad comprehension syntax in Haskell. The examples
are inspired by the work on joinads and include parsers, parallel and concurrent computations.</p>

        <p class="datepub">Tomas Petricek. Unpublished draft, 2007</p>
        <p>  This paper presents one of the first "Ajax" programming frameworks that let you develop
integrated client/server applications in an integrated way using a single language. The
framework lets you use F# on both sides and provides a smooth integration between client
and server-side code.</p>
