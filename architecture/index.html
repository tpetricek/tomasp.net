<h3>Tomas Petricek</h3>

<h3>Preface</h3>
<p class="lead">
  I have been interested in architecture and how it relates to software for some time now.
  I have written about this topic <a href="https://tomasp.net/blog/tag/architecture/">on my blog</a> and also in <a href="https://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/metaphors.pdf">Onward! 2021 paper</a>.
  My <a href="https://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/">earlier writings</a> have been inspired by Christopher Alexander, Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch and Stewart Brand.
  Two years ago, I got my hands on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144899417-oppositions-reader">Oppositions Reader</a>, which is a collection of
  mostly theoretical and critical writings on architecture from a range of different post-modern perspectives.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  Reading critical architectural writings inspired me to ask different kinds of questions about software. 
  The works cited in this text are focused more on the meaning of architecture than (directly) on the problems of achieving fit or producing living structures.
  However, it is not just writings. Post-modern architects often used architecture itself to question architectural practice and its social context.
  I believe it is worthwhile to explore software from the same critical perspective. 
  I also believe that finding ways of using software as the medium for making statements can make the much needed critical investigations of software more commonplace.
</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p class="lead">
  I think I found some interesting questions to explore, but I certainly do not have the answers to many of them yet. 
  While this text may be nicely formatted, it is a collection of early notes at best.
  I tried to summarize my understanding of some of the architectural ideas and find interesting
  counterparts in the world of software and programming systems, but those still need to be fully worked out. 
  I hope this text will gets you to think about interesting things. I would love to hear about those,
  as well as any other comments and feedback that you may have!

<section>
<h2 id='critical_language_for_software'>Critical Language for Software</h2>
<p>
This text is an attempt to develop such critical language of software. To do so, I will draw on
a number of architects and architectural critics. Their work provides an inspiration for
what, I believe, is needed for software. Some of those critiques are in the form of written text,
but more notably, architects also use building plans and buildings themselves to raise important
points about architecture. I believe we, programmers and computer scientists, similarly need to
find ways of designing software that not only fulfils a certain function, but also raises critical
questions. I acknowledge a certain irony in my effort. What you are looking at is itself text
and not a piece of software.</p>

<p>Although I started with Alexander's comment and I share his belief that programmers and computer
scientists should not accept the role of &#8220;guns for hire,&#8221; my thinking follows a different
route than that suggested by Alexander&#8212;one that would likely not make Christopher Alexander
himself very happy.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_1'>1</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_1'><sup>1</sup> Alexander expressed disagreement with some of the ideas that I take
inspiration from clearly in the 1982 debate with Peter Eisenman (<a href='#alexander-1983-debate'>Alexander and Eisenman, 1983</a>).</span>
Rather than seeking a way of building that achieves a living structure, I turn to debates
on architecture that emerged from post-modern critical architecture and debates about it.</p>

<p>Even if our sole goal as programmers and computer scientists was to produce &#8220;living
structures&#8221; in the world, I do not think we can achieve this without first having a critical
language that lets us reflect on our work, criticise existing approaches, deconstruct our creations
and look for alternative arrangements.</p>

<p>In other words, I believe there is a value in exploring disharmony<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_2'>2</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_2'><sup>2</sup> In the debate
(<a href='#alexander-1983-debate'>Alexander and Eisenman, 1983</a>), Alexander argues that architects are &#8220;entrusted with the creation
of (&#8230;) harmony&#8221; whereas Eisenman points out that &#8220;disharmony might be part of the cosmology
that we exist in&#8221;. I agree with Eisenman that it is worth to explore this disharmony.</span>
and in using a critical language of architecture&#8212;or in my case of software&#8212;to
criticise the state of the discipline and imagine new ways of thinking and new ways in which
software can support social structures. Although I mainly look to writing on post-modern ar
chitecture for sources of inspiration, the idea of using buildings to question established order
is by no means new. We can trace similar ideas to the rise of modernism in Europe following
the First World War when some architects &#8220;overwhelemed by the nightmare of industrialization
(...) briefly speculate on alternative condition&#8221;:<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_3'>3</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_3'><sup>3</sup> <a href='#frampton-1998-crises'>Frampton (1998, p.55)</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
It is not the crazy caprice of a poet that glass architecture will bring a new culture.
It is a fact. (&#8230;) Therefore the European is right when he fears that glass architecture
might become uncomfortable. Certainly it will be so. And that is not its least advantage.
For first of all the European must be wrenched out of his coziness.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>On the next couple of pages, I will look at two themes from post-modern architecture that
highlight some of the aspects of the critical language developed by architects that I hope
to create for software. I will then return to methodological problem of how such language
can be structured.</p>

<section>
<h2 id='the_ironical_column'>The Ironical Column</h2>
<p>
To illustrate some of the ways through which architects use architecture to communicate, I start
with the most basic structural element of classical architecture, the column. <a href='#fig_columns'>Figure 1</a>
shows several uses of columns, starting from the ancient Parthenon built in Athens in 5th century
BC (bottom left) followed by four examples that include a variety of references to the classical
column.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_4'>4</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_4'><sup>4</sup> The discussion on columns is inspired by <a href='#silvetti-1998-shadows'>Silvetti (1998)</a> and
also the review by <a href='#korman-2023-facade'>Korman (2023)</a>.</span></p>

<p>Neoclassical architecture, which gradually grew in prominence in the late 18th century, looks
back to the Classical past. It sees it as a source of pure geometric order with ideal proportions
and symmetry. The return to the architecture of the antiquity started during the Renaissance
period in the 15th and 16th century. This included the rediscovery of the Ten Books on Architecture
(&#8220;De architectura&#8221;) by Roman architect Vitruvius and Andrea Palladio's architecture that aimed
to design according to ideal proportions, inspired by his studies of antiquity. In the 17th and
18th century, Palladio's study of symmetry and formal classical architecture inspired a new
interpretation of classical architecture and also one of the styles of neoclassical
architecture.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_5'>5</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_5'><sup>5</sup> <a href='#aureli-2011-absolute'>Aureli (2011)</a>. Before the scientific revolution,
ancient philosophers were seen as the source of truth that was partly lost but was already
fully known to the ancients (<a href='#wootton-2015-invention'>Wootton, 2015</a>). The focus on classical architecture
in the 16th century is thus not unexpected. The interpretation changed gradually in the 17th
century, adding early empirical studies of ancient ruins, but the interest remained.</span>
Neoclassical architecture remained influential after the 18th century, but its meaning
slowly shifted. It turned from an attempt to rediscover and recreate simple, purely geometrical
structures to an idealized style that emphasises tradition. The use of the style for many US federal
buildings is thus a reference to the values that the style encompasses.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_6'>6</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_6'><sup>6</sup> The conservative
connotations of neoclassical architecture can be also illustrated by the
&#8220;Executive Order on Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture&#8221; issued by the Trump
administration (<a href='#trump-2020-beautiful'>Trump, 2020</a>).</span></p>

<p>The modernist Villa Savoye designed by Le Corbusier also looks back to the Classical past,
but it does so in a different way. Rather than directly copying the style and order of the
ancient Greek temples, the building is a reinterpretation of the ideas of a Greek
temple.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_7'>7</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_7'><sup>7</sup> <a href='#unwin-2024-twentyfive'>Unwin (2024)</a></span>
It reimagines the ideal structure of Greek temple based on geometric principles (using the golden
ratio), but replaces ancient Greek columns with minimalistic modernist pilotis. Following the
modernist focus on function, Le Corbusier's design uses pilotis to give prominence to the
automobile (parked on the ground floor). Although the same historical reference is present in Villa
Savoye, it is used at a more conceptual level and is not immediately apparent.</p>

<p>The importance of the column as an icon representing a certain style of architecture was well
understood by other modernist architects, including Adolf Loos who is best known as the author
of the modernist manifesto &#8220;Ornament and Crime&#8221;, first presented as a lecture in 1910. In his entry
for the Chicago Tribune headquarters competition in 1922, Loos made yet another reference to the
ancient Greek temple and shaped the entire building as a giant Doric column.  Loos himself did not
view the column in his design as ornamental and instead saw it as supporting the public nature of
the building with appropriate symbolism.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_8'>8</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_8'><sup>8</sup> <a href='#krul-2011-doric'>Krul (2011)</a></span>
The structure of the building itself here becomes the symbol in a way that is reminiscent
of later post-modernist works where construction patterns and material textures themselves become
ornament.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_9'>9</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_9'><sup>9</sup> <a href='#jencks-2012-postmodernism'>Jencks (2012, p.183)</a></span> Despite being rooted in the modernist thinking, the Chicago Tribune
Tower project became an inspiration for later post-modern architects who make, more or less subtle,
historical references in an ironic way. They will include columns in their buildings to indicate
that they recognize being a part of architectural culture and tradition, even if they no longer
need columns as structural support mechanisms.</p>

<p>A good illustration of the ironic reference is the facade created by Hans Hollein for the 1980
Venice Biennale. The event took place in Corderia of the Arsenale, a large historical building
itself featuring supporting columns. The participants of the Biennale were asked to design a
facade for their exhibition that would cover (and hide) the historical structure of the Corderia.
Hollein did the exact opposite. He complemented two columns of the Corderia with a range of
ironical forms of columns. One was a bushy tree cut into the shape of a column, while another was
a scaled-down version of Loos' Chicago Tribune Tower. The entrance into the exhibition was under
a hanging fragment of a column, which clearly lost its original structural function, but gained
a different function as an exhibition entrance. Here, the ironical use of the architectural
language is direct and understandable.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_10'>10</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_10'><sup>10</sup> <a href='#branscome-2020-hollein'>Branscome (2020)</a></span></p>

<p>Hollein's entry addressed the theme of the Biennale, &#8220;The Presence of the Past&#8221; in a way that
is funny and ironic, but sends a clear message about history and continuity of architecture. It
also illustrates the changing function of a column from supporting structure to a decoration. Moreover,
the ironical style of the presentation, shared with many other post-modern architectural works, makes
the message accessible and engaging for broader public. Hollein's facade is interesting for
yet another reason. It uses architectural language to communicate architectural ideas, but it
is neither text, nor a building. As we will see repeatedly, built structures such as stage sets
or monuments are often interesting media through which critical architectural ideas can be
expressed.</p>

<p>The column takes yet another form in the addition to the Allen Memorial Art Museum designed by
Robert Venturi in 1977. The extension itself is based on an idea that Venturi refers to as
the &#8220;decorated shed&#8221;. The basic structure and spatial disposition of the building itself is
simple and serves its function which was, in part, to provide more storage space.
Any symbolic, cultural and aesthetic meaning is provided &#8220;by modifying the basic shell by means
of design decisions of a second order.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_11'>11</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_11'><sup>11</sup> <a href='#colquhoun-1998-sign'>Colquhoun (1998, p.182)</a></span> One such second-order
decision is the addition of isolated iconic elements, such as the mock Ionic column that
marks the building as cultural institution. In a way, the column serves similar role as the
neoclassical architecture of the US National Archives, but is here added merely as an ironic
decoration. The association of ancient Greek columns with important public buildings remains,
but the story is told in a very different way.</p>

<h2 id='towards_critical_software'>Towards Critical Software</h2>
<p>In my attempt to translate the critical langauge of architecture into the world of software,
I will alternate between two modes of working. First, I will reinterpret existing practices
in software development and computer science in light of the architectural theory. Second,
I will suggest how we could more deliberately follow in the footsteps of architects and
create new software artifacts that express critical points about software.</p>

<p>In other words, can we follow post-modern architects and embed criticism as a first-class
element in software practice, rather than leaving it to a second-class (and largely optional)
critical writing?<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_12'>12</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_12'><sup>12</sup> <a href='#venturi-1977-complexity'>Venturi (1977, p.13)</a> writes as an &#8220;architect who
employs criticism rather than a critic&#8221;, while <a href='#silvetti-1998-shadows'>Silvetti (1998, p.377)</a> describes
a mode of criticism he calls &#8220;criticism from within&#8221;.</span> We can also look to
post-modern architects for initial ideas of what such critical software can say. The
architectural style known as eclecticism makes funny references such as Hans Hollein who
decorated his Austrian Travel Agency office with metalic palm trees and broken Greek
column.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_13'>13</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_13'><sup>13</sup> <a href='#jencks-2012-postmodernism'>Jencks (2012, p.56)</a></span> The appeal of the style is not just its straightforward humour,
but the fact that it is understandable and can communicate with wider audience. Similarly,
post-modern architects have used contextualism to highlight important characteristics of the
environment they work in or use references to suggest alternative social organization.</p>

<p>Looking at existing software practices, we can imagine how the above architectural ideas
can apply to basic structural elements from which software is built. One such element may
be the data structures around which software is structured.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_14'>14</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_14'><sup>14</sup> As <a href='#mccullough-1996-craft'>McCullough (1996, p.96)</a>
points out, &#8220;data structures characterize software&#8221;. As noted by <a href='#jakubovic-2022-ladder'>Jakubovic and Petricek (2022)</a>,
another element is how change to the state is specified.</span> Data structures
in software are arguably even more fundamental than columns in architecture, because any
software that works with data needs to store the data in some way. The limitation of this
metaphor is that, unlike columns which are typically visible, data structures are typically
hidden from the end-user. There also is no singular classical model of data structures,
although a number of models fit a similar role. These include the relational model of databases,
flat memory model of low-level programming languages and data types that model data as collections
of nested records.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_15'>15</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_15'><sup>15</sup> Memory models that underlie different programming languages are
discussed by <a href='#sitaker-2016-models'>Sitaker (2016)</a>.</span></p>

<p>We can use the architectural metaphor to talk about the differnt kinds of classical models
of data structures. Whereas the relatively expressive language of the relational model or
the nested records model could be linked to different kinds of classical columns, the minimalistic
models of flat memory or nested lists of the Lisp programming language are more akin to
modernists undecorated and purely functional pilotis.</p>

<p>When the data structures are used to store data, they serve the original intended purpose,
just like columns functioning as supporting structure. But equally, there are software systems
where data structures are used more as rhetorical elements, intended not for the computer
execution of the software, but for the end-user or programmer. One example would be types
in the TypeScript programming language. Here, the actual representation of data can be anything
permitted by the underlying JavaScript runtime. TypeScript type declarations are mere labels,
intended for the human and for the static TypeScript type checker, but they are not enforced or
used for checking at runtime. The type declarations still look like a definition of the shape
of a data structure (a column), but they no longer play the basic structural function. They are
used for paratial checking (a scaffolding around a column?) and as information for the
programmer (a purely rhetorical column). A similar case would be the use of data structures
in non-relational databases such as key-value stores or document databases. The data stored
in such systems in practice has some implicit structure.  However, any explicit description
of the structure is merely literal. The description may use the language of standard data
structures (collections, records, primitive types), but this is not used for representation.</p>

<p>Do certain data structures also have particular symbolic associations, in a manner similar
to how the Classical column stands for traditional values, often associated with US federal
buildings? I believe this is the case. For instance, the class-based object-oriented
programming paradigm is often associated with maintainability. Languages that adopt
class-based object-oriented abstractions as their basic data structure do not do so
just for practical, but also for symbolical reasons. TypeScript serves to illustrate this
again. One of the first books on the language claims that &#8220;TypeScript [brings] a level of
maintainable structure to JavaScript development through its class and module
features.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_16'>16</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_16'><sup>16</sup> <a href='#maharry-2013-typescript'>Maharry (2013)</a></span> Written in the same year when
the language was released, the claim could not rely on empirical experience with the language,
but mainly on the symbolic associations of the data structure.</p>

<p>For my last example based on a reference to an existing artefact, I want to show that
data structures have already been used to make critical ironical statements. The April Fool's
post written by Charles Petzold in 2006 introducing the &#8220;C# Application Markup Language&#8221;
is a illustration.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_17'>17</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_17'><sup>17</sup> <a href='#petzold-2006-csaml'>Petzold (2006)</a></span>
The post introduces a new notation that encodes programs written in the C# language
using XML (<a href='#fig_csaml'>Figure 2</a>). The post can be seen as an ironical work of contextualism.
The post was published in the heyday of the XML format when Microsoft released multiple
development frameworks built around XML. As a well-written April Fool's joke, the post
made readers think. The post praises the semantic clarity of the XML format and gives
various examples that are extremely lengthy and tedious. After a brief puzzlement, most readers
realise the joke. But the post makes them wonder about the verbosity and unnecessary
overuse of the format at the time.</p>

<p>The C# Application Markup Language example hints at a number of themes that I will further
explore later. It is perhaps blatantly funny, but it can still be seen as making a serious point.
Moreover, the system that the post describes has never been actually implemented. The post
is merely a (very basic) plan for a system. This does not, however, make it any less valuable
as critical software. Many interesting pieces of critical architecture have also not been
built, yet, they became important references. The Chicago Tribune tower by Adolf Loos is one
such case, but even better example would be one of the many architectural projects that
use the architectural language to intentionally propose structures that cannot be built.
One such project is The Strip (<a href='#fig_exodus'>Figure 3</a>) by Rem Koolhaas. The project imagines
an enclosed restricted city cutting through London. Although the work was inspired by the
situation of West Berlin during the Cold War, the ideas of building a wall to separate cultures
can be seen in new (and alarming) light today.</p>

<p>In the subsequent chapters, we will see that hypothetical design proposals, fictional
plans that cannot be built or impractical systems are a powerful way of making a point
about software systems, just like they are a powerful way of making a point about architecture.
The C# Application Markup Language can be seen an example of a much broader class of
esoteric programming languages, which are created jokingly, but can be often read as
valuable critiques.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_18'>18</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_18'><sup>18</sup> The mechanism through which esoteric programming languages

<section>
<p>As I wrote earlier, I believe that we can take inspiration from the critical architectural
language both to analyze existing software systems and projects, but also to come up with
new ideas. Some of the references to a column that I discussed earlier make points that
may well be applicable to software systems. For example, they may ironically highlight the fact
that a column is used for its symbolic value, but not for its original purpose.
They highlight the fact that it is no longer needed functionally, even if it is often used
for rhetorical reasons.
We can imagine a range of similar critical points to be raised about the technical concept
of data structures in the context of programming and software systems. If a column is no longer
needed as a structural element, what may be the established essential aspect of data structures
that is no longer needed?</p>

<p>One of the most established ideas associated with structuring application data is that of
information hiding.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_19'>19</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_19'><sup>19</sup> Introduced by <a href='#parnas-1972-criteria'>Parnas (1972)</a>, who also later reflected
on the development of the notion (<a href='#parnas-2002-history'>Parnas, 2002</a>)</span>
The argument is that one should separate software systems into components that have a stable
public interface and private implementation. If one identifies suitable stable public interface,
it is possible to develop the components in isolation, change the implementation or replace
individual components as needed. But information hiding has also been criticised.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_20'>20</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_20'><sup>20</sup> For
example, by <a href='#kell-2020-convivial'>Kell (2020)</a>, <a href='#steimann-2018-fatal'>Steimann (2018)</a>, <a href='#petricek-2021-architecture'>Petricek (2021)</a>
and <a href='#clark-2017-gpii'>Clark and Basman (2017)</a>.</span> The problem is
that predicting what part of the interface should be fixed and what can be hidden is often
difficult, especially in the context of software systems whose function evolves and changes
over time. Clark and Basman<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_21'>21</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_21'><sup>21</sup> <a href='#clark-2017-gpii'>Clark and Basman (2017)</a></span> quote the example of MIDI SysEx messages that
have, by convention, become a mechanism that exposes the state and can control the operation
of musical devices. This enabled MIDI to become a powerful music control platform in a way
that could not have been anticipated by the designers of the MIDI interface in the 1980s.
Arguably, an even more prominent example would be the web platform, where much of the data
structures that the web is built around (HTML, CSS) are also transparent.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_22'>22</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_22'><sup>22</sup> But even in the
context of the web, the transparency has limits (<a href='#petricek-2021-popup'>Petricek, 2021</a>).</span></p>

<p>So far, most ciritiques of information hiding have taken the form of text. To make the point
through the critical language of software, we should design an exemplar piece of software
or programming system that reverses the idea of information hiding. In other words, we
should expose all the underlying data structures of the software in a way that is akin to how
the Centre Pompidou (<a href='#fig_pompidou'>Figure 4</a>) exposes all the service infrastructure of the
building.</p>

<p>In such hypothetical system,<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_23'>23</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_23'><sup>23</sup> Such as the GPII Nexus presented by <a href='#clark-2017-gpii'>Clark and Basman (2017)</a>.</span> all the state of the system
would be externalised in a way that allows anyone to see and modify it. To make the point,
the system should do this to the extent possible. The accessible state should include all
information about the data structures, as well as execution of the system. Depending on the
chosen programming paradigm, this may include data of all objects, memory, stack, currently
executing instructions etc. The information should also be exposed in a way that makes it
available not just to the programmer, but also to the end-user.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_24'>24</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_24'><sup>24</sup> Systems that provide
programmer access to internal information include image-based programming systems and systems that
support reflection such as Smalltalk and CLOS (<a href='#goldberg-1983-smalltalk'>Goldberg and Robson, 1983</a>; <a href='#kiczales-1991-clos'>Kiczales et al., 1991</a>),
but this is often accessible only in a highly technical way.</span> The system would have to handle the fact that
its state may be modified in inconsistent ways and could either recover as best as possible
(akin to how web browsers recover when encountering invalid HTML) or break (likely making an
interesting point about the fragility of software systems).<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_25'>25</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_25'><sup>25</sup> Possibly exploring ideas
hinted at in the work on antifragile software by <a href='#monperrus-2017-antifragile'>Monperrus (2017)</a></span>
The color coding used in the Centre Pompidou offers another interesting idea. If we exposed
all data structures of a software system using similar color coding (for different aspects
of the system), the system would increase public awareness about what modern software consists
of. Thus the project can also fulfil an educational function.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a practical issue of the context in which such project can become
reality. It is entirely possible to develop a critical software system only in the form of
specification or description, much like Charles Petzold's C# Application Markup Language.
However, to explore the consequences of the design&#8212;and see how a system can be used in
the absence of information hiding&#8212;an actual non-trivial working implementation is needed.
I will return to this problem later, but architecture has a variety of options. Many
architects explore their theories for houses built for their own use or their
family.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_26'>26</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_26'><sup>26</sup> Two prominent examples include the The Gehry Residence by Frank Gehry and the
Vanna Venturi House built by Robert Venturi.</span> Similarly, programmers and computer
scientists often have their own projects to experiment on.</p>

<p>Architecture also often speaks through
non-building objects such as stage sets, public monuments, pavilions and follies or exhibitions.
Those may not (yet) have obvious equivalents in the world of software and the task of developing
critical language of software may involve finding those. Last but not least, new architecture
also sometimes emerges in isolated places within a large city, called heterotopias in reference
to Michel Foucault.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_27'>27</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_27'><sup>27</sup> <a href='#jencks-2012-postmodernism'>Jencks (2012, p.119)</a></span> Such isolated spaces, such as prisons, ghettos,
amusement parks, or leftover spaces known as terrain vague.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_28'>28</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_28'><sup>28</sup> <a href='#haluzik-2020-mestonaruby'>Haluzík (2020)</a></span>
I believe we can similarly find a range of atypical pieces of software, which are often deemed
as unimportant, but provide space for experimentation. Ad-hoc scripts, demos, spreadsheets,
and programs created at hackathons or coding competitions are only a few examples of hterotopias
in the world of software.</p>

<section>
<h2 id='formal_grammars_of_architecture'>Formal Grammars of Architecture</h2>
<p>In the previous two sections, I focused on ideas that approach architecture from
the particular, specifically the structural element of a column. I will now look at ways
of developing critical language for architecture starting from the general.
I look at a number of works, most notably by Peter Eisenman, that relate architecture to
language, art and their formal structures and grammars (<a href='#fig_grammar'>Figure 5</a>).</p>

<p>The most direct reference to formal grammar in the context of architecture comes
from Peter Eisenman's PhD thesis, completed in 1963 at University of Cambridge. His thesis,
&#8220;The Formal Basis of Modern Architecture&#8221; is concerned with formal analysis of
form and formal order in modern architecture. Eisenman suggests that the architectural form
can be seen as a problem of logical consistency, rooted solely in the properties of basic
structures from which the architectural form arises. The view opposed that of modernists who saw
form as arising from function, as well as Christopher Alexander's view put forward in his
Notes on the Synthesis of Form.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_29'>29</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_29'><sup>29</sup> The contrast between the perspectives is illustrated
by the debate between Eisenman and Alexander (<a href='#alexander-1983-debate'>Alexander and Eisenman, 1983</a>)</span> In contrast with modernists:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Eisenmann saw modernist forms not as simple derivatives of functional needs, but as
delineations of the immanent self-referntial properties of architectrue itself,
as searches for objective knowledge that lies outside both the architural agent's intentions
and the building's uses, and inside the very materials and formal operations of
architecture.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_30'>30</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_30'><sup>30</sup> <a href='#hays-1998-oppositions'>Hays (1998, p.x)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The time was probably right for this kind of intellectual project.
Eisenman was influenced by his reading of the linguist Noam Chomsky,<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_31'>31</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_31'><sup>31</sup> <a href='#corbo-2014-eisenman'>Corbo (2014)</a></span>
who published his first work on formal languages and grammars at the end of the 1950s. The
same ideas also contributed to the development of formal grammars of programming languages at
the end of the 1950s.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_32'>32</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_32'><sup>32</sup> <a href='#nofre-2014-language'>Nofre et al. (2014)</a></span></p>

<p>Eisenman's thesis is analytical. He considers the plans of a range of modern buildings,
including those by Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto, and explains their
structure in terms of a number of simple formal principles. Those include three basic
kinds of movement systems throughout the building (pinwheel, spiral, echelon), three types
of volumetric systems (horizontal planes, vertical planes, plaid) and various interactions
between them that lead to distortions of and dislocations in the basic structure.</p>

<p>One building analyzed by Eisenman is the modernist Casa del Fascio in Como designed by
Giuseppe Terragni. Eisenman sees the formal structure of the building as the product of
&#8220;reconciliation between a centroidal plan and a linear site.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_33'>33</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_33'><sup>33</sup> <a href='#eisenman-2006-formal'>Eisenman (2006)</a></span>
The form is a hollowed out cube. The cube can be seen as a series of planes, which needs
to be acknowledged by the side facades and which imposes a connection between the front and
the rear facade. To accommodate access to the inner courtyard, which results from the centroidal
plan, the &#8220;negative volume is then dislocated&#8221; giving the frontal facade reading of
an H-form.</p>

<p>Eisenman's analysis may seem like a curious theoretical exercise, but architects who study
the structure or the langauge of architecture had a more fundamental objective. Their aim
was to establish autonomous architecture, that is architecture that &#8220;opens the internal
processes of architecture to their own internal possibilities.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_34'>34</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_34'><sup>34</sup> <a href='#eisenman-2000-critical'>Eisenman (2000)</a></span>
In other words, they seek architecture that is not created in response
to various external forces (of which there are many), but that is rooted in its own basic
(necessary) principles.</p>

<p>Eisenman himself went on to explore various uses of a formal architectural
grammar, not just analytically, but also as the basis for new designs in his numbered series of
houses, some built and some unbuilt. The House X, for instance, is a critique of &#8220;the idea of
development from simple to complex&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_35'>35</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_35'><sup>35</sup> <a href='#gandelsonas-1998-lang'>Gandelsonas (1998, p.219)</a></span> by using the L-shape as the
starting point, replacing the conventional cube. The design questions the humanist ideology
by disrupting the centrality that is typical of most houses. Where one might expect a hearth or
a staircase, there is nothing. The fact that this introduces a degree of disharmony in the project
has become contentious issue. While, Eisenman argued that an importnat role of art and architecture
is reminding people that &#8220;everything isn't all right&#8221;, Christopher Alexander in a debate said
that such design makes him &#8220;incredibly angry&#8221; and he saw projects that introduce disharmony
as &#8220;fucking up the world&#8221;.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_36'>36</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_36'><sup>36</sup> <a href='#alexander-1983-debate'>Alexander and Eisenman (1983)</a></span></p>

<p>In the 1980s, the experiments with architectural language, its grammar and the decomposition
of architectural structures took another form. Influenced by the French philosopher Jacques
Derrida, architects started to use architectural language to question the basic structures
and their conventional meaning. Eisenman himself collaborated with Derrida on a
project for a garden in the Parc de la Villette. The proposal eventually developed
 into a scheme that rescales and overlays a number of different structures including
historical state of the site when it was a part of city walls and other projects by Eisenman
and his collaborators.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_37'>37</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_37'><sup>37</sup> The project is documented in a book &#8220;Chora L Works&#8221;, which is
a collection of essays and design materials by Peter Eisenman and Jacques Derrida (<a href='#kipnis-1997-chora'>Kipnis and Leeser, 1997</a>)</span></p>

<p>The almost mechanical design method is used to destabilize traditional
values of architecture such as its human scale and function. The authors propose to do this by
making parts of the park unexpectedly large or small, or by making parts inaccessible.
The La Villette project thus uses the architectural language to question the basic assumptions
of architecture. The project, again, causes the kind of disharmony that would enrage Christopher
Alexander.</p>

<p>In a critical commentary on the Parc de la Villette, Jeffrey Kipnis explained that
the point of deconstruction is to &#8220;battle with the very meaning of architectural
meaning.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_38'>38</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_38'><sup>38</sup> <a href='#kipnis-1997-chora'>Kipnis and Leeser (1997, p.137)</a></span> Because &#8220;deconstruction deconstructs the
homogeneity, the unity of style&#8220; it cannot, according to Jacques Derrida yield to
a single architectural style. Yet, this is what, perhaps somewhat inadvertently, happened
in the 1980s when the theoretical works of Eisenman got jointly exhibited with more literal
or pragmatic works by architects such as Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid or the Austrian firm Coop
Himmelb(l)au.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_39'>39</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_39'><sup>39</sup> Two exhibitions presented the new movement almost at the same time in
1988: Deconstruction in Architecture at the Tate Gallery in London (<a href='#papadakis-1988-deconstruction'>Papadakis, 1988</a>)
and Deconstructivist Architecture at The Museum of Modern Art in New York) (<a href='#johnson-1988-deconstructivist'>Johnson and Wigley, 1988</a>).</span></p>

<p>An early example of what became known as deconstructivist architecture is the series of Frank
Gehry's residential designs of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Gehry's work combines
experiments with different materials and spatial dynamics with the rejection of the modernist
grid.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_40'>40</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_40'><sup>40</sup> The work is documented, for example, by the catalogue of the &#8220;Frank Gehry:
Architect&#8221; exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum <a href='#ragheb-2001-gehry'>Ragheb (2001)</a></span>
His formal structures are inspired less by grammars of Chomsky, but by avant-garde artists.
For example, the &#8220;main masses [of his Familian Residence house] form a clearly Supermatists
grouping, recalling Malevich's Red Square and Black Square.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_41'>41</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_41'><sup>41</sup> <a href='#gibson-1988-mythology'>Macrae-Gibson (1988, p.25)</a></span>
As noted by Charles Jencks, &#8220;Gehry’s method of Deconstruction can be quite literal at
times, since he will smash an existing building into parts, leave elements of his own work
unfinished and (...) make an aesthetic virtue of rough, crumbled surfaces.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_42'>42</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_42'><sup>42</sup> <a href='#papadakis-1988-deconstruction'>Papadakis (1988, p.18)</a></span>
Yet, despite the different aesthetic and conceptualization
of the work, there is a clear connection between the work of Eisenman and Gehry. In some of their
works, they both try to uncover basic forms that comprise architectural structures and reveal them
through distortion.</p>

<p>The formal abstract structure, resulting from the composition of primitive architectural forms,
was also the basis for Eisenman's design for the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe,
also known as the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. The same formal mechanisms that were used as
a critique of humanism in architecture are used to create an unnerving experience for the
visitor.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_43'>43</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_43'><sup>43</sup> Callaghan, M. (2020). Empathetic Memorials. Palgrave Macmillan Memory Studies.</span>
The abstract form of the memorial, devoid of symbolism and narrative, &#8220;grants no further
understanding, since understanding the Holocaust is impossible.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_44'>44</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_44'><sup>44</sup> <a href='#eisenman-2005-berlin'>Eisenman&#32;Architects (2005)</a></span>
In other words, the Holocaust Memorial is a structure that calls exactly for the kind of
disconcerting disharmony that Eisenman explored in his early house designs. According to
a brief explanation provided by Eisnman:<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_45'>45</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_45'><sup>45</sup> <a href='#eisenman-2005-berlin'>Eisenman&#32;Architects (2005)</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
This project manifests the instability inherent in what seems to be a system, here a
rational grid, and its potential for dissolution in time. It suggests that when a supposedly
rational and ordered system grows too large and out of proportion to its intended purpose,
it loses touch with human reason. It then begins to reveal the innate disturbances and potential
for chaos in all systems of apparent order.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The formal architectural language explored by Eisenman since the start of his career thus
finds a new kind of use in the memorial. As with the Facade of Morphed Columns for the Venice
Biennale, the Holocaust Memorial is a different kind of architectural place, or a heterotopia,
where different architectural language can be, and needs to be, explored.</p>

<h2 id='questioning_the_structure_of_software'>Questioning the Structure of Software</h2>
<p>
Architects who probe formal structures of the architectural language may do so to better understand
the language, uncover assumptions that we accept and rarely question and explore consequences of
changing or manipulating the language. As in the previous section, this is often done using the
architectural language itself. Eisenman's numbered series of houses, Gehry's residences and Parc
de la Villette were all planned to be built and a number of them still stand.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_46'>46</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_46'><sup>46</sup> And even houses
built to question the humanist focus of architecture sometimes found their satisfied owner (<a href='#blair-2002-whiteelephant'>Blair, 2002</a>).</span>
This fact, again, points at the possibility of a critical language that is not external to the subject
matter, but integrated within it. That is, the use of architecture to make critical architectural points
or, in the case I am interested in, the use of programming and software to make critical points about
software.</p>

<p>In some cases, architects use other formats too. Eisenman's doctoral work was a text presenting
a formal analysis of existing buildings. The deconstructivist practice can be used to probe the
process of architecture, as well as other artifacts it involves. For example,
Eisenman also criticises humanist ideology of architecture through the
axonometric model of the House&nbsp;X (<a href='#fig_axonometric'>Figure 6</a>), which makes
&#8220;the `normal' image appear to be an anomaly.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_47'>47</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_47'><sup>47</sup> <a href='#gandelsonas-1998-lang'>Gandelsonas (1998, p.219)</a></span>
Similarly, computer scientists and programmers should include a broader range of materials in
their notion of critical language of software, including formal definitions, software
specifications and demonstrations. Those can, no doubt, be constructed in a similarly
illuminating distorted manner as Eisenman's axonometric model.</p>

<p>The analytical way of looking at basic structures of the language of the subject matter is something
that computer scientists are well familiar with. It has been done at multiple levels. On one
level, formal models of computations such as Turing machines and the lambda calculus have been
used to describe the basic structure of computation. Like the grammar that reduces architecture
to relationships between basic shapes, formal models of computation reduce program execution to
a minimal set of operations. That said, there is a difference between computing and architecture
in that formal models of computation originate in logic and have been conceived to study
computability properties, rather than originating in the analysis of existing programs.</p>

</section>


<section>
<p>We can interpret software design patterns as another attempt to uncover the basic
structure of software. The influential Gang of Four design patterns book<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_48'>48</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_48'><sup>48</sup> <a href='#gamma-1994-patterns'>Gamma et al. (1994)</a></span> identifies
and catalogues some 24 design patterns, which appear repeatedly in past software systems. The
patterns are common structures defined by relationships between classes and interfaces in an
object-oriented systems and each design pattern captures one particular structure
of relationships (<a href='#fig_strategy'>Figure 7</a>). Although the Gang of Four book is a collection of
a larger number of patterns whereas Formal Basis of Modern Architecture is inspired by the structure
of formal grammars, they are both similar in that they analyze existing systems (software or modern
architecture) to identify and describe their formal underlying structure.</p>

<p>Linking software patterns to Eisenman's work is ironic in that Alexander and Eisenman saw
their approaches as being in direct opposition,<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_49'>49</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_49'><sup>49</sup> As illustrated by the 1983 debate between
the two architects (<a href='#alexander-1983-debate'>Alexander and Eisenman, 1983</a>).</span> but I believe drawing the connection
may be revealing. Whereas Alexander focused on creating &#8220;living structures&#8221;, Eisenman is looking
for &#8220;formal structures&#8221;. The Gang of Four design patterns are sometimes criticised for lacking
this essential &#8220;living&#8221; aspect emphasized by Alexander. The notions that Alexander has been
looking for are more likely to be found in the work of Richard Gabriel<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_50'>50</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_50'><sup>50</sup> <a href='#rpg-1996-patterns'>Gabriel (1996)</a></span>
than in the widely used Gang of Four patterns. Despite using the name and structure of Alexander's
design patterns, software patterns may well be more akin to Eisenman's formal analysis.</p>

<p>On another level, there have been attempts to analyze and describe how software systems are made of
high-level concepts, which are rooted in the specific domain that the systems are designed
for. In a book titled &#8220;The Essence of Soware&#8221;,<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_51'>51</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_51'><sup>51</sup> <a href='#jackson-2023-essence'>Jackson (2023)</a></span> Daniel Jackson views software
as collection of interacting concepts. As an example, concepts involved in a social media
platform like Facebook include that of a post, comment, like and a friend. The exact structure
and interactions between such concepts then determines how the system behaves, how it can be
used and also its social implications.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_52'>52</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_52'><sup>52</sup> <a href='#tufekci-2017-twitter'>Tufekci (2017)</a> describes how
different architectures of social media platforms support different kinds of social structures
and interactions.</span></p>

<p>All of those formal structures in software&#8212;models of computation, design patterns and
concepts&#8212;can be used as analytical tools for understanding and analysing existing software
as well as help programmers in creating new things. You can use models of computations as a
basis for a new language, patterns to design an extensible software system or concepts to
create an intelligible application.</p>

<p>An important lesson that post-modern architecture teaches us is that we can use such formal structures
in another way. We can use them to reveal the insufficiencies of our established practices, question
hidden assumptions and reveal the contradictions often present in software desing and development.
To paraphrase Eisenman,<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_53'>53</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_53'><sup>53</sup> <a href='#alexander-1983-debate'>Alexander and Eisenman (1983)</a></span> (admit and) show that everything is not all right. The
discussion in the previous section, alongside with the illustrations shown in <a href='#fig_grammar'>Figure 5</a>,
suggest some ways in which this can be done. We can use formal structures in a more or less distorted way,
follow a methodology in an excessively rigorous way, or start with an atypical arrangement
of the basic structures.</p>

<section>
<p>
I doubt there are many designers of programming languages who have studied work of post-modern
and deconstructivist architects and then decided to design a programming language according to
the same principles. But looking at some existing programming languages, we can imagine what
this might look like. If we decide to use the lambda calculus as our primary model of computation,
there are multiple ways in which this formal structure can be turned into a programming language.
Taking the core structures of the formal model (variables, lambda functions and application) and
building a programming language around them involves bridging a large gap.
A realistic programming language will need much more than the three basic primitives. Languages like
Haskell resolve any design concerns that arise from this gap using a reasonable programmer's
intuition&#8212;they aim at building a practically usable system.</p>

<p>It is equally possible to use the same formal model of computation and highlight the gap&#8212;what
remains to be added in order to design a practically usable programming language is by
no means obvious. One illustration of this is the esoteric programming language
Unlambda<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_54'>54</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_54'><sup>54</sup> <a href='#madore-2003-unlambda'>Madore (2003)</a></span> created by David Madore. The language is based on a
combinatory logic that is related to the lambda calculus and expresses computation in terms
of three primitive combinators written as S, K and I. Unlambda turns the formal model into a
programming language that makes it possible to write and execute programs, such as the following
Fibonacci number calculator:<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_55'>55</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_55'><sup>55</sup> Adapted from an example by <a href='#madore-2003-unlambda'>Madore (2003)</a></span></p>


<pre><code class='language-plaintext'>```s``s``sii`ki
  `k.*``s``s`ks
 ``s`k`s`ks``s``s`ks``s`k`s`kr``s`k`sikk
  `k``s`ksk</code></pre>

<p>Unlambda supports a number of further functional programming concepts including continuations
and lazy evaluation, and the <code>.*</code> construct prints the <code>*</code> character and returns it.
Unlambda makes no attempt to be practically useful. As noted by the author &#8220;[w]riting Unlambda
programs isn't really as hard as it might seem; however, reading Unlambda programs is practically
impossible.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_56'>56</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_56'><sup>56</sup> <a href='#madore-2003-unlambda'>Madore (2003)</a></span>
Unlambda is an ironical demonstration that brings to light a fact that is not otherwise easy
to see. Contrasting Haskell and Unlambda shows how little of the design of the Haskell language is
really determined by its core formal computational model&#8212;an interesting lesson about programming
language design!</p>

<p>
Last, but not least, we can also explore the case of integrating primitive structures from multiple
formal models of computation. For example, many contemporary programming languages that are based
on different principles (such as imperative, object-oriented languages) now support the
key concept from the lambda calculus, that is a lambda function. (Incidentally, this replaces
the Strategy design pattern illustrated in <a href='#fig_strategy'>Figure 7</a>.) Such combination of
different formal structures poses a problem both for the language designers and the language users.
The designers have to resolve the contradictions that arise from the integration of different
formal structures. The complexity of the capture clause in C++ lambdas would be one example
of this difficulty.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_57'>57</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_57'><sup>57</sup> <a href='#whitney-2023-lambdas'>Whitney and contributors (2023)</a></span>
At the same time, the users of the language now have to carefuly choose between the multiple
available formal structures. To point out that this is not alway easy, we can use an ironical
example such as the two recursive computations shown in <a href='#fig_ycombinator'>Figure 8</a>.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_58'>58</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_58'><sup>58</sup> The
code snippet shows the Z combinator, based on a version shared at <a href='#rosetta-2025-ycombinator'>Rosetta&#32;Code (2025)</a>.</span>
A bit like Gehry's residential projects, the
example &#8220;smashes&#8221; together parts of the programming language, making an aesthetic virtue of
&#8220;rough, crumbled&#8221; lines of code. In both architecture and software, this distortion of the
simple structure is also associated with higher maintenance costs.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_59'>59</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_59'><sup>59</sup> For example, the
maintenance costs of Frank Gehry's Stata Center have been a subject to a lawsuit by MIT (<a href='#pogrebin-2007-gehry'>Pogrebin and Zezima, 2007</a>).</span></p>

<section>
<p>One caveat in my comparison between architecture and structures that appear in programming is
that source code and programming languages typically remain hidden from sight. In contrast, the
distorted formal structurs of post-modern architects are visible to their inhabitants. In case of
public buildings, the structures can send a message about the institution it hosts. For example,
the appearance of the MIT Stata Center (<a href='#fig_stata'>Figure 9</a>) &#8220;is a metaphor for the freedom,
daring, and creativity of the research that's supposed to occur inside it.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_60'>60</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_60'><sup>60</sup> <a href='#campbell-2004-dizzying'>Campbell (2004)</a></span>
A less charitable reading of the building would be that it is a defensible use of the
desires associated with the Late Capitalism to &#8220;make it an interesting test of constructional
capability.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_61'>61</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_61'><sup>61</sup> A point made by <a href='#jencks-2012-postmodernism'>Jencks (2012, p.172)</a> about
The New Milan Trade Fair designed by Massimiliano and Doriana Fuksas.</span> Either way, the
visibility of the structure justifies its existence and its greater maintenance costs.</p>

<p>Here, the analogy between software and deconstructivist architecture raises another interesting
question. Should the inner structures of programs remain hidden from their users, or should
we strive to make the inner structures visible and comprehensible?
Like architecture, software design is often the result of contradictory forces that
arise from the user needs, physical or virtual environment and financial interests.
An inner structure reflects those forces and, if it was transparent to the user or inhabitant
of software, they would gain greater understanding of the software. (Perhaps, it would not
take a massive security vulnerability like the 2014 Heartbleed bug to see that the core
infrastructure of modern internet is critically underfunded.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_62'>62</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_62'><sup>62</sup> <a href='#perlroth-2014-heartbleed'>Perlroth (2014)</a></span>)
The fact that greater transparency would then, incidentally, also allow software designers to
speak through the structure of their software would be an additional benefit of the greater
transparency. I will return to this topic and how such transparency could be achieved
later in this chapter.</p>

<p>High-level concepts, such as those identified by Daniel Jackson can be more visible and
understandable to software users, so they have a greater potential as devices for communication.
Seeing the concepts behind software still systems requires careful attention. As Jackson points
out, &#8220;to learn about concepts, we need to see what happens when they go wrong.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_63'>63</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_63'><sup>63</sup> <a href='#jackson-2023-essence'>Jackson (2023, p.15)</a></span>
Similarly, the structures behind architecture become visible when they are intentionally or accidentally
distorted. Some post-modern architects use this fact to their leverage&#8212;using such
distortions of the architectural language to speak to their audience.</p>

<p>An engaging and widely relatable project that distorts familiar concepts is the User
Inyerface challenge (<a href='#fig_inyerface'>Figure 10</a>). The web page shows a familiarly looking
user registration form, but it employs all possible poor design practices to make the completion
of the form as hard as possible. The web page is composed from standard underlying concepts,
but each of those concepts is mapped to a user element that is unsuitable in some way.
In some ways, the example is similar to the case of the esoteric programming language Unlambda
that I discussed earlier. Like Unlambda, the User Inyerface web page is based on reasonable
underlying structures (combinatory logic or concepts of a registration form), but it shows that
turning the reasonable underlying structure into an actual programming language or an interface
requires resolving a number of remaining design problems.</p>

<p>A variety of interesting buildings and software systems emerge from the need or desire to combine
multiple structures in a single resulting form. One example was the plan for the garden in Parc
de la Villete by Eisenman and Derrida which overlaid a number of different structures on the single
site. Similarly, I discussed how some conterporary programming languages combine multiple models
of computation earlier in this section, as well as how the interaction between those leads to
contradictions. We can see the same pattern with high-level concepts of software.</p>

<p>Before talking about software, I want to look at one more architectural example.
The Hotel Fouquet (<a href='#fig_hotel'>Figure 11</a>) was built in a quarter of Paris with
strict regulations that require architects to follow the structure of historical
buildings in the area. The concrete facade mimics the style of a previous building in
fine details, but the facade covers a building with a different internal structure.
The internal structure is visible through the windows and doors that stand out from the facade.
The Hotel Foquet is an eye-catching example of a building that combines two formal structures.
On the outside, it follows the style of buildings of the Haussmann's 19th century renovation
plan for Paris, as required by the regulations. On the inside, it is a modern hotel building with
floors and rooms arranged according to an internal logic. The windows and doors are the only
points of interaction between the two structures.</p>

<p>If we pay attention, we can see the same interaction between multiple structures in
one of the first examples that Daniel Jackson uses in his conceptual analysis of software.
He looks at a sample screenshot of a Facebook page and notes that &#8220;three concepts are evident:
post (represented by the message and the associated image), like (represented by the emoticons
at the bottom left), and comment (represented by the link on the bottom right).&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_64'>64</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_64'><sup>64</sup> <a href='#jackson-2023-essence'>Jackson (2023, p.30)</a></span>
Looking at a screenshot is a way of uncovering concepts from the perspective of the user&#8212;the
facade of the hotel. But our conceptual analysis can equally focus on the inside of the
hotel. That is, the business model of Facebook, which has been described using the term
surveillance capitalism.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_65'>65</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_65'><sup>65</sup> <a href='#zuboff-2019-capitalism'>Zuboff (2019)</a></span> As an alternative to screenshot, we can look at the claim
from the litigation by human rights campaigner Tanya O'Carroll who sued Meta (owner of Facebook)
to respect her GDPR &#8220;right to object&#8221; to being profiled.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_66'>66</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_66'><sup>66</sup> <a href='#ocarroll-2022-meta'>O'Carroll (2022)</a></span>
The concepts that are evident in the claim include direct marketing material (advertisements,
promoted content), personal data (user's age, gender, location, content interactions),
categories (ad interests, ad topics, your topics). When browsing Facebook, we only see the front
facade. The promoted posts and advertisements we see are hints of a parallel conceptual
structure of the system that we can only see if we look harder. The existence of those structures
and the need to look for them and expose them is another useful lesson that the world of software
can take from critical post-modern architecture.</p>

<h2 id='ways_of_achieving_fit'>Ways of Achieving Fit</h2>
<p>
What I hope to achieve in this text is to document the ways through which architecture can convey
critical understanding and see if those ways let us talk about important issues concerning software. I moved
away from Christopher Alexander, for whom the main question that matters is whether building (or software)
produces living structures in the world.</p>

<p>I think that buildings and software should also raise critical points and much of the above was
exploring some of the ways in which this can be done in software. I would now like to return
to the basic question of how structures achieve good fit. This is a question that Christopher
Alexander studies in detail in his &#8220;Notes on the Synthesis of Form,&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_67'>67</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_67'><sup>67</sup> <a href='#alexander-1964-synthesis'>Alexander (1964)</a></span> a book based
on his PhD research written before his work on design patterns. This is, incidentally,
also the text that infuriated Peter Eisenman who than opposed it in his own thesis on formal
analysis of architecture.</p>

<p>According to Alexander, &#8220;every design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness
between two entities: the form in question and its context. The form is the solution to
the problem; the context defines the problem.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_68'>68</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_68'><sup>68</sup> <a href='#alexander-1964-synthesis'>Alexander (1964, p.15)</a></span> According to Alexander,
the problem is that, in anything but the most simple scenarios, &#8220;we cannot give an adequate
description of the context we are dealing with.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_69'>69</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_69'><sup>69</sup> <a href='#alexander-1964-synthesis'>Alexander (1964, p.20)</a></span> The real-world is too
complex and so an attempt to logically deduce the form from a description of the context is bound
to fail. The different methods of achieving fit illustrated in <a href='#fig_fit'>Figure 12</a>
approach this problem differently.</p>

<p>The first approach to the problem is used by vernacular architecture, that is building done
locally, in traditional ways and without guidance of professional architects. We do not need
to appropriate &#8220;charms of fairy-tale countries&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_70'>70</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_70'><sup>70</sup> A condescending narrative
criticised by <a href='#rudofsky-1964-architecture'>Rudofsky (1964, p.3)</a>.</span> to explain this approach. Aside from
the Musgum mud huts, Alexander talks about New England barns and my illustration is a typical
farmhouse in the southern region of Czechia. The way good fit is achieved in vernacular
architecture is by gradual adaptation. When building a new farmhouse, the local builder follows
the same style as everyone else in the region. Since the needs of most farmers are similar,
this will result in an adequate solution. When the context changes, the building style evolves
gradually by small adaptations. A change is tried in one farmhouse and if it is beneficial, it is
then replicated by other builders. In this mode of working, little is demanded from the individual
builder. &#8220;He need not himself be able to invent forms at all. (...) All that is required is that
he should recognize misfits and respond to them by making minor changes.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_71'>71</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_71'><sup>71</sup> <a href='#alexander-1964-synthesis'>Alexander (1964, p.58)</a></span>
Even if the changes are not improvements, it does not matter. They will simply not be adopted
by others in subsequent buildings.</p>

<p>According to Alexander, the professionalization of architecture destroyed this old process.
However, Alexander also admits that the degree of complexity faced by modern architects is
greater than that of vernacular builders. You cannot build a skyscraper using the method that
works for a farmhouse. Professional architects thus approach the problem by analyzing the context
and inventing a form to fit. This is the modernist methodology, rooted in the maxim &#8220;forms follows
function.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_72'>72</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_72'><sup>72</sup> A design principle coined by the architect Louis Sullivan.</span>
Two examples of modernist architecture that illustrate different
variations on the theme above are Villa Tugendhat and Isokon Flats. Villa Tugendhat was built as
a private residence, to create &#8220;a complete vision of luxurious Modernist
living.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_73'>73</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_73'><sup>73</sup> <a href='#jamrozik-2021-growing'>Jamrozik and Kempster (2021, p.83)</a>; The history and architecture of the
villa is documented in a book by <a href='#tostoes-2022-modernheritage'>Tostões (2022)</a>, which documents its restoration.</span>
As such, it featured open plan living space, retractable glazed walls and a floor plan that
reflects the needs of the family, including an easy access through the garage and a separate
driver's appartment. In contrast to the generous space of the Villa Tugendhat, Isokon Flats were
designed as &#8220;minimal flats,&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_74'>74</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_74'><sup>74</sup> <a href='#daybelge-2019-isokon'>Daybelge and Englund (2019, p.60)</a>; the concept was
influenced by the 1929 CIAM (Congr\`{e}s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne) congress, which
had &#8220;The Minimum Dwelling&#8221; as its theme.</span> inspired by the question of &#8220;how much space
individuals needed to live in comfortably.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_75'>75</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_75'><sup>75</sup> <a href='#daybelge-2019-isokon'>Daybelge and Englund (2019, p.59)</a></span>
The flats were built for young professional men and women and provided a range of domestic services
and meals made in a central kitchen. The two buildings are daring examples of radical new design
that reflects the changing context. Both of the buildings invent a new form that and aims to
achieve fit by analyzing the context and by emplying technical innovations.</p>

<p>Christopher Alexander developed a range of different approaches to the problem of achieving
fit throughout his career. In &#8220;Notes on the Synthesis of Form&#8221;, he suggests that
&#8220;we should see the process of achieving good fit (...) as a negative process of neutralizing
the incongruities, or irritants, or forces, which cause misfit&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_76'>76</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_76'><sup>76</sup> <a href='#alexander-1964-synthesis'>Alexander (1964, p.24)</a></span> and
he describes an analytical incremental approach that identifies sub-problems (clusters of
interlinked concerns) and gradually resolves those. His later work describes the problem as the
search for what he calls &#8220;quality without a name&#8221;, which happens when an environment is
free of contradictions. In the writing on design patterns, Alexander and his collaborators
replace the unwritten knowledge of vernacular architecture with an explicit pattern language.
A good pattern language can then be used to design living structures:<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_77'>77</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_77'><sup>77</sup> <a href='#alexander-1964-synthesis'>Alexander (1964, p.134)</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Each living pattern resolves some system of forces, or allows them to resolve themselves.
Each pattern creates an organization which maintains that portion of the world in balance.
(...) And finally the quality without a name appears (...) when an entire system of patterns,
interdependent at many levels, is all stable and alive.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Sala house designed by Alexander shown in <a href='#fig_fit'>Figure 12</a> employs numerous patterns to achieve
the quality without a name. Sleeping is organized in alcoves (involving patterns such as Bed Cluster,
Alcove, Marriage Bed), the house relies on natural light (Tapestry of Light and Dark, Sunny Place),
and the inside of the house is in relationship with the outside garden (Connection to the Earth).
The process relies on an extensive pattern language, which Alexander painstakingly developed with
his co-authors over multiple years. The pattern language is supposed to capture the shared
understanding of the community, which makes it possible to construct agreeable environment.
Alexander's pattern language, however, leads to a particular style of buildings and Alexander
himself later asked whether patterns are enough to generate the living structures he desires.
Moreover, the buildings built using his pattern language are pleasant in a specific way and it is
not clear whether the same approach can be used to construct other types of pleasant
buildings.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_78'>78</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_78'><sup>78</sup> <a href='#petricek-2022-timelessway'>Petricek (2022)</a></span></p>

<p>Christopher Alexander is not the only one who believes that the modernist rational approach
to achieving fit is bound to fail. Robert Venturi, sometimes referred to as one of the founding
fathers of post-modernism,<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_79'>79</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_79'><sup>79</sup> Venturi himself does not agree with this label, which also ignores
the fact that his work was in close collaboration with Denise Scott Brown.</span> wrote in his 1966 book &#8220;Complexity and
Contradiction in Architecutre&#8221; that Mies van der Rohe &#8220;makes wonderful buildings only because
he ignores many aspects of a building. If he solved more problems, his buildings would be far
less potent.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_80'>80</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_80'><sup>80</sup> <a href='#venturi-1977-complexity'>Venturi (1977, p.16)</a></span> Venturi also cites Alexander
to highlight that problems faced by architects &#8220;increase in quantity, complexity and they also
change faster than before.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_81'>81</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_81'><sup>81</sup> <a href='#venturi-1977-complexity'>Venturi (1977, p.16)</a>, citing <a href='#alexander-1964-synthesis'>Alexander (1964)</a></span>
But rather than trying to resolve the resulting contradictions, Venturi welcomes them:<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_82'>82</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_82'><sup>82</sup> <a href='#venturi-1977-complexity'>Venturi (1977, p.16)</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
I like complexity and contradiction in architecture. I do not like the incoherence or
arbitrariness of incompetent architecture nor the precious intricacies of picturesqueness
of expressionism. Instead, I speak of a complex and contradictory architecture based on the
richness and ambiguity of modern experience, including that experience which is inherent in art.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In his &#8220;Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture,&#8221; Venturi documents a large number of
examples of architecture that accommodates complexity and contradiction using both historical
examples and his own projects. The church in Dobrá Voda, shown above, illustrates Venturi's point
that the complexity of a site supports richness lacking in purer compositions.{<a href='#venturi-1977-complexity'>Venturi (1977, p.28)</a>}
The church is built in a village on a hill with a steep slope. Reflecting the site,
the Baroque entrance is from the side of the nave and is visible from the open countryside
that it faces&#8212;becoming an appealing landmark.</p>

<p>I talk about Venturi in a section focused on achieving fit mainly because of his later work,
&#8220;Learning from Las Vegas&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_83'>83</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_83'><sup>83</sup> <a href='#venturi-1972-learning'>Venturi et al. (1972)</a></span> written with Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour.
The book is a study of the commercial strip, &#8220;important to architects and urbanists today
as were the studies of medieval Europe and ancient Rome and Greece to earlier generations.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_84'>84</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_84'><sup>84</sup> <a href='#venturi-1972-learning'>Venturi et al. (1972, p.xi)</a></span>
For Venturi and his collaborators, the analysis &#8220;is a socially desirable activity to the
extent that it teaches us architects to be more understanding and less authoritarian.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_85'>85</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_85'><sup>85</sup> <a href='#venturi-1972-learning'>Venturi et al. (1972, p.6)</a></span></p>

<p>Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour point out that architects have typically been trying to change
the existing environment rather than enhancing what is already there. The way of achieving
fit with the new complex environment is thus to first understand the existing environment
and its language&#8212;and then build with accordance to the language. In the case of the commercial
strip, documented in the book, the language is primarily a language of signs, billboards, arrows
and visual symbols. The &#8220;obvious visual order of the street&#8221; is in contrast with the &#8220;difficult
visual order of buildings and signs.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_86'>86</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_86'><sup>86</sup> <a href='#venturi-1972-learning'>Venturi et al. (1972, p.20)</a></span> This multi-layered formal structure is not
unlike that of the Hotel Foquet discussed in the previous section.</p>

<p>The authors use the lessons learned as a justification for their own approach to architecture,
which they call the decorated shed. According to this perspective, the architectural form of
the building does not matter that much. A decorated shed is designed and built as a conventional
shelter, reflecting &#8220;proprietor's budget.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_87'>87</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_87'><sup>87</sup> <a href='#venturi-1972-learning'>Venturi et al. (1972, p.13)</a></span> An additional content is added to
the building in the form of signs&#8212;either as literal signs in the case of Las Vegas strip or
as explicit decorations in case of more ordinary buildings. The fact that the authors look
specifically at the commercial strip (and the Levittown suburb in their follow-up work) for
inspiration reflects their acknowledgement of existing American culture&#8212;a position that
is shared with the pop art movement. Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour can thus be seen as
assuming &#8220;the role of servant to society&#8221; whose task &#8220;is to understand and interpret
the wishes of the client.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_88'>88</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_88'><sup>88</sup> <a href='#colquhoun-1998-sign'>Colquhoun (1998, p.178)</a></span> This is in contrast to the modernist
tendency &#8220;to elevant client's value system and/or budget by reference to Art and
Metaphysics.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_89'>89</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_89'><sup>89</sup> <a href='#venturi-1972-learning'>Venturi et al. (1972, p.102)</a></span></p>

<p>The view of Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour that architecture is &#8220;embedded in a global ideology
from which there is no escape&#8221; is also a negation of the perspective of Peter Eisenman and a
group referred to as &#8220;the New York Five&#8221; who see &#8220;architecture as an autonomous
discourse.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_90'>90</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_90'><sup>90</sup> <a href='#colquhoun-1998-sign'>Colquhoun (1998, p.186)</a></span> This school of architecture offers yet another perspective on
the problem of achieving fit. As I discussed earlier, Eisenman is interested in developing
architectural forms as formal structures, rooted in a formal architectural language and
without direct reference to humanist ideals. His architecture is &#8220;true to its own
logic.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_91'>91</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_91'><sup>91</sup> <a href='#eisenman-1983-findout'>Eisenman&#32;Architects (1983)</a></span>
The problem of achieving fit is no longer a driving factor behind architecture, but
something that can emerge as its effect. How less likely this is when compared
to other approaches likely depends on the degree to which the complexity of the problem of
achieving fit, which other architects explicitly try to address, is tractable.</p>

<p>The idea that structures emerging from formal manipulation will find their use is not
exclusive to the proponents of autonomous architecture like Eisenman.
The architectural style known as contextualism also disregards functionalist rationales
and instead recognizes and replicates elements from the local environment. For &#8220;if
Americans won't promenade in urban plazas perhaps they will ice skate in them.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_92'>92</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_92'><sup>92</sup> <a href='#cohen-1998-context'>Cohen (1998, p.67)</a></span></p>

<h2 id='vernacular_software'>Vernacular Software</h2>
<p>The essential characteristics of vernacular architecture is that it is produced in traditional
ways, without professional architects and that it achieves fit through gradual adaptation.
It typically only needs to address problems of limited complexity. Vernacular architecture
also develops over long periods of time, so its relevance to the world of software is not
immediately apparent. Yet, there are some connections worth exploring.</p>

<p>The web of the 1990s had many of the characteristics of the vernacular architecture and this
fact has been documented in articles and talks by the internet artist and theorist
Olia Lialina. In her article &#8220;A Vernacular Web&#8221;,<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_93'>93</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_93'><sup>93</sup> <a href='#lialina-2005-vernacular'>Lialina (2005)</a></span>
Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as &#8220;bright, rich, personal, slow and under</p>

<p>construction&#8221;, but also documents its vernacular nature and its demise:<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_94'>94</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_94'><sup>94</sup> <a href='#lialina-2009-folk'>Lialina and Espenschied (2009, p.19)</a></span></p>

<section>
<p>The web pages of the mid-1990s were often hosted on the free web hosting service GeoCities, which
offered a simple template-driven web generator or an advanced editor for users familiar with HTML.
Pages were organized in neighborhoods that grouped content by topic, but also simplified discovery
of other content.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_95'>95</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_95'><sup>95</sup> The early years of the GeoCities community have been documented
by <a href='#milligan-2017-welcome'>Milligan (2017)</a>.</span> Although the web pages had widely varying content and
graphics, many of them shared a particular style (<a href='#fig_geocities'>Figure 13</a>). They were also
often created using the typical methods of vernacular architecture&#8212;by copying existing structures.
In particular, the modular nature of the web meant that &#8220;every line, figure, button and sound was
on its own and could easily be extracted, if not directly from the browser then from looking at the
source code to find the URLs of the files.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_96'>96</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_96'><sup>96</sup> <a href='#lialina-2009-folk'>Lialina and Espenschied (2009, p.24)</a></span> The reusable components of the
1990s web, such as backgrounds, buttons, music and dividers were available from collections
maintained by other users.</p>

<p>Another area where we can find aspects of vernacular way of working is programming, as practiced
by the members of the hacker community at the MIT in the 1960s. The hacker community emerged around
the first available interactive computers, TX-0 and PDP-1. It embraced ideas of openness and
sharing as well as individual ingenuity and skill.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_97'>97</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_97'><sup>97</sup> The complex history and narratives about
the history of hackers has been pointed out by <a href='#haigh-2021-hackers'>Haigh (2021)</a>, who also notes that the
movement was associated with a distinctive new form of masculinity.</span> Hackers did not learn programming
through formal education, but through practice and by working with other members of the community.
The hacker culture differs from vernacular architecture in that the problems solved by hackers
were often very challenging and required great individual ingenuity. The ways and the tools
through which they solved the particular programming problems were shared by the community
and improved by a process of gradual adaptation.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_98'>98</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_98'><sup>98</sup> <a href='#petricek-2025-cultures'>Petricek (2025)</a></span> There is also a
similarity between the largely unwritten community knowledge of hackers<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_99'>99</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_99'><sup>99</sup> <a href='#beeler-1972-hakmem'>Beeler et al. (1972)</a></span>
and the unwritten community knowledge of vernacular builders. The way of working
personified by the 1960s MIT hackers keeps finding its use in various areas of computer programming
to this day. However, as a dominant way of building software, the methods of early computer hackers
were replaced with an orderly software engineering method.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_100'>100</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_100'><sup>100</sup> I documented the history
in my work on cultures of programming (<a href='#petricek-2025-cultures'>Petricek, 2025</a>).</span></p>

<p>Both of the above examples share interesting characteristics with vernacular architecture.
They rely on unwritten knowledge shared by a community and also on some notion of copying
and reuse. Whereas in vernacular architecture, it is necessary to copy a form when constructing
new buildings, vernacular web creators relied on literal copying of code, graphics and other
media elements. The fate of those vernacular computing practices also followed the fate of
vernacular architecture. As observed by Alexander, &#8220;with the invention of a teachable discipline
called `architecture,'  the old process of making form was adulterated and its chances of success
destroyed.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_101'>101</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_101'><sup>101</sup> <a href='#alexander-1964-synthesis'>Alexander (1964, p.58)</a></span> The new &#8220;teachable disciplines&#8221; that led to the end of the
vernacular web and vernacular hacker programming were professional web design or user experience
design and the discipline of software engineering, respectively. Both of those replace the
unwritten knowledge and the practice of copying and learning from the community with the
analysis of the context and (re)invention of new forms to fit the context. It is also the case that,
like modern architecture, both modern user experience design and software engineering face problems
of a greater scale and complexity.</p>

<p>
When Bernard Rudofsky organized the exhibition &#8220;Architecture Without Architects&#8221; that popularized
the term &#8220;vernacular architecture&#8221; in 1966, he was one of the first to recognize that our
attitude to traditional architecture &#8220;is plainly condescending&#8221; and that:<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_102'>102</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_102'><sup>102</sup> <a href='#rudofsky-1964-architecture'>Rudofsky (1964, p.3--4)</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
There is much to learn from architecture before it became an expert's art. The
untutored builders in space and time (...) demonstrate an admirable talent for
fitting their buildings into the natural surroundings.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Architects and designers have, since then, learned to recognize the value of vernacular and
indigenous architecture.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_103'>103</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_103'><sup>103</sup> For example, &#8220;Lo-TEK&#8221; (<a href='#watson-2019-lotek'>Watson, 2019</a>) embraces
vernacular architecture to look for sustainable, resilient, nature-based technology.</span>
I believe that computer scientists and programmers should similarly look to their vernacular
past for interesting ideas.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_104'>104</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_104'><sup>104</sup> More generally, <a href='#chang-2004-complementary'>Chang (2004)</a> introduces
the idea of complementary science, arguing that it is worthwhile to recover ideas from our
scientific past. Work by <a href='#rankin-2018-peoples'>Rankin (2018)</a>, <a href='#ankerson-2018-dotcom'>Ankerson (2018)</a> can be seen as going
in the outlined direction, although focusing more on the social context. My reconstruction of
Commodore 64 BASIC is also an attempt to go in this direction (<a href='#petricek-2020-c64'>Petricek, 2020</a>).</span></p>

<p>The vernacular web culture is perhaps closer to the pop signs of the commercial vernacular
of Las Vegas than to rural vernacular praised by Alexander. In any case, it developed into a unique
creative culture and the GeoCities service itself hosted over 38 million pages by the time it was
shut down in 2009, most of which were created by enthusiasts and non-professionals. How exactly
this was achieved would be a subject of a fascinating socio-technical study of the era, but
there are some easily identifiable technical factors that enabled this. First, the GeoCities
template-based web page generator made it easy for users to get started, but it did not restrict
them. There was a natural transition from a novice user to someone who can fiddle with the
HTML source code, modify it and, through this process, gradually learn more about the technology.
Second, the modularity of the early web made it easy to copy and reuse aspects of other sites.
This included graphics and media, but also parts of the HTML markup and, later, JavaScript code
that was often used to implement &#8220;pop&#8221; visual effects such as rollover (changing an image when
a mouse cursor is over it) or mouse followers (element that follows the mouse cursor).</p>

<p>The technical characteristics that enabled the vernacular web could well be built into new
programming systems. The first requirement is that there should be gradual progression from
an end-user to a novice and, eventually, to an expert. This requires transparency. When a
simple user-friendly tool guides you through the creation of new content, you still need to be
able to see (and interactively engage with) the underlying representation, or source code, of
the result. The same transparency is necessary for sharing of knowledge in the community.
When a user finds some component or behavior interesting, they need to be able to locate its
implementation, copy it (easily extracting only the relevant parts) and reuse it. The domain
where this is perhaps most needed is educational software. And systems such as Scratch let
you explore the gallery of other users' creations, see inside them and &#8220;remix&#8221; them
(although extracting and copying components is still challenging).</p>

<p>The programmers of the 1960s MIT hacker culture illustrate another characteristic of
vernacular architecture mentioned above&#8212;an adminarable talent for fitting their software
into their technical environment. An example that illustrates this is the Spacewar! game
(<a href='#fig_spacewar'>Figure 15</a>) that was built to showcase the technical capabilities of the
PDP-1 computer. The initial version of the game featured two spaceships with thrust, shooting
torpedos at each other. Additional ideas proved challenging to implement. Adding gravity and
realistic star map required inventing clever programming tricks such as compiling a special-purpose
program at the start of the game to rotate the spaceship.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_105'>105</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_105'><sup>105</sup> Rotation is briefly mentioned in
the &#8220;Spacewar&#8221; article by <a href='#brand-1972-spacewar'>Brand (1972)</a>. A more detailed discussion of the game
has been written by <a href='#daemmrich-2020-spacewar'>Daemmrich (2020)</a></span></p>

<section>
<p>Aside from illustrating a unique degree of fit achieved by the vernacular programming practices
of the hackers, the Spacewar! example lets me illustrate another interesting parallel with
architecture. In architecture, some of the most radical ideas appear in structures that are not
regular buildings. This includes monumnets and follies, exhibition pavilions or stage sets.
The ironic column in the 1980 Venice Bienale was one example I mentioned earlier. Another is
the German pavilion built by Mies van der Rohe for the 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona,
which exhibited the open floor plan and column-supported roof that we saw just six years later
in the Villa Tugendhat.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_106'>106</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_106'><sup>106</sup> <a href='#neumann-2020-barcelona'>Neumann (2020)</a> docments the history of the
Barcelona Pavillion.</span> In the world of software, demonstrations are one kind of software that plays a similar role.
The special context of software demonstrations makes it possible to use them for playful purposes
or to illustrate specific technical abilities&#8212;such as running an interactive game with gravity
and realistic star map on a 730kg computer with a total memory of 4,000 of 18-bit words.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to use the lens of vernacular architecture to look at the development
of programming languages too. As documented by Leo Meyerovich and Ariel Rabkin,
&#8220;the original designers of today’s popular languages are typically not experienced in programming
language design.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_107'>107</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_107'><sup>107</sup> <a href='#meyerovich-2012-socioplt'>Meyerovich and Rabkin (2012)</a></span>
This alone does not make them vernacular, but the languages are often created in the
software equivalent of &#8220;the most complicated configurations in the landscape.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_108'>108</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_108'><sup>108</sup> <a href='#rudofsky-1964-architecture'>Rudofsky (1964, p.4)</a></span>
In words of Meyerovich and Rabkin, &#8220;a common pattern is for programmers with expertise in other
domains to create a language when they perceive an unmet need.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_109'>109</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_109'><sup>109</sup> <a href='#meyerovich-2012-socioplt'>Meyerovich and Rabkin (2012)</a></span>
Programming languages not designed by programming language designers often achieve their
fit by solving a more specific problem that is initially perceived as simple. They can even be
well-optimized for the initial specific problem. What they lack, or exhibit only in a limited
form, is the gradual adaptation. In case of programming languages, this is typically prevented
by the fact that once a language gains some users, it becomes impossible to change it.</p>

<p>Perhaps if each software project had to start by creating its own programming language&#8212;just
like each farmer needs to build a barn&#8212;we would eventually get a vernacular programming
language, highly optimized for its environment!</p>

<section>
<h2 id='modernism_of_conceptual_coherence'>Modernism of Conceptual Coherence</h2>
<p>It would be simplistic to reduce modernist architecture to the problem of achieving fit.
As we saw above, modernist architects were interested in finding and supporting new modern ways
of living. But this often came together with the need to find new architectural forms.</p>

<p>The way of thinking about software that comes the closest to modernist architecture is
the notion of conceptual integrity, developed by Fred Brooks in his influential book
&#8220;The Mythical Man-Month&#8221;.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_110'>110</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_110'><sup>110</sup> <a href='#brooks-1975-manmonth'>Brooks (1975)</a></span> As with modernist architecture, conceptual integrity
is not merely about achieving good fit or developing a system according to its specification.
It is also about internal logic and clarity of the involved structures:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Every part must reflect the same philosophies and the same balancing of de\-siderata.
Every part must even use the same techniques in syntax and analogous notions in semantics.
Ease of use, then, dictates unity of design, conceptual integrity.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_111'>111</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_111'><sup>111</sup> <a href='#brooks-1975-manmonth'>Brooks (1975, p.44)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Even though Brooks talks about internal consistency of the design, the motivating factor
is function. It is not&#8212;as with architects exploring formal grammars&#8212;internal consistency
of formal structures detachd from the reality. But for &#8220;a given level of function, (...) that
system is best in which one can specify things with the most simplicity and
straightforwardness.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_112'>112</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_112'><sup>112</sup> <a href='#brooks-1975-manmonth'>Brooks (1975, p.44)</a></span>
In software, the problem of achieving internal consistency is as tricky as the problem of achieving
fit between the form and the context in architecture. Brooks believed that it is possible to
achieve conceptual integrity if the design proceeds &#8220;from one mind, or from a very small number
of agreeing resonant minds.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_113'>113</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_113'><sup>113</sup> <a href='#brooks-1975-manmonth'>Brooks (1975, p.44)</a></span></p>

<p>Interestingly, the modernist methodology in the world of software also partly responded to
the newly emerging &#8220;modern&#8221; ways of using software. The Mythical Man-Month was published
in 1975. It reflected the author's experience of working on the operating system for the
new IBM/360 line of computers. However, it also appeared a couple of years after other two
major developments in the software industry. One was the 1968 NATO conference on Software
Engineering that introduced the very term &#8220;software engineering&#8221; and is sometimes seen as
marking the move from the &#8220;black art of programming&#8221; to the new science of &#8220;software
engineering&#8221;.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_114'>114</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_114'><sup>114</sup> documented in cultures; ensmenger etc.</span></p>

<p>Another development was related more to the way computers were employed by businesses.
The influential McKinsey report &#8220;Unlocking the Computer's Profit Potential&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_115'>115</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_115'><sup>115</sup> <a href='#mckinsey-1969-unlocking'>McKinsey&#32;and&#32;Company (1969)</a></span>
published in 1968 argued that many &#8220;large companies have successfully mechanized the bulk
of their routine clerical and accounting procedures&#8221; using computers. According to the report,
most companies were only slowly realizing that the &#8220;second stage of the computer revolution,
unlike the first, entails real operational changes.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_116'>116</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_116'><sup>116</sup> <a href='#mckinsey-1969-unlocking'>McKinsey&#32;and&#32;Company (1969, p.30)</a></span>
In other words, the managers responsible for the use of computers need to move from simple
automation of existing processes to finding new ways of utilizing computers in their companies.
I would argue that there is a similar interplay in this development as in the modernist
architecture. Just like modernist architecture reflected and enabled new modern way of living,
new modernist approach to software development has been interconnected with new modern ways
of using computers from the 1970s onward.</p>

<p>The software development methodologies of the 1970s are now perhaps more obviously outdated
than the modernist architecture of the 1930s. What followed them&#8212;and to what extent can the
different alternatives be related to various post-modern tendencies in architecture&#8212;would be
an interesting question to explore further. There may be some interesting analogies.
I will look at ideas inspired by formalism of Eisenman and post-modernism of Venturi later.
Concerning development methodologies specifically, many of the later developments learned to
better acknowledge the &#8220;complexity and contradiction&#8221; involved in the typical sofware project.
Distributed open-source development methodologies characterized by Raymond in &#8220;The Cathedral and
the Bazaar&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_117'>117</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_117'><sup>117</sup> <a href='#raymond-1999-cathedral'>Raymond (1999)</a></span> emerge from complex social structures, but are at least as effective
as Brooks' &#8220;one mind&#8221;; the Agile development methods aim to achieve fit by gradual adaptation
and would be closer to vernacular methods praised by Alexander.</p>

<p>Critics of modernist architecture and modernist urban planning pointed out a number
of its limitations. Many of those are also relevant for software. One of them has been
pointed out by French architect and theoreticiaan Bernard Tschumi:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
While the puritanism of the Modern Movememnt and its followers has often been pointed out,
its refusal to recognize the passing of time has rarely been noticed. (Not surprisingly,
glass and glazed tiles have been among the preferred materials of the movement&#8212;for
they do not reveal the traces&nbsp;of&nbsp;time).<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_118'>118</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_118'><sup>118</sup> <a href='#tschumi-1998-transgression'>Tschumi (1998, p.360)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Software systems do not decay in the same literal way as the materials used in buildings
(there is no plaster falling off the concrete blocks of the software equivalent of the
Villa Savoye as discussed in Tschumi's article). The kind of decay that software faces is more
often caused by changes in its environment, that is the context that initially shaped the form.
In the world of software, the requirements change as the situation in the real world that the
software responds to changes, the technical platforms and systems on which software runs change,
programming languages and styles evolve and components the software is built from change
(npm packages being the most notorious example).</p>

<p>Modernist software is not built to adapt well, just like most modernist buildings are not
built to adapt well. Modernist architecture &#8220;made the profound mistake of taking a
snapshot of the high-rate-of-change `organic life' within building and immobilizing it
in a (...) low-rate-of-change structure and skin of the building.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_119'>119</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_119'><sup>119</sup> <a href='#brand-1994-learn'>Brand (1994, p.157)</a></span>
Or as Stewart Brand puts it &#8220;The credo `form follows function' was a beautiful lie.
Form froze function.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_120'>120</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_120'><sup>120</sup> <a href='#brand-1994-learn'>Brand (1994, p.157)</a></span> The possibility of designing more adaptable building,
as well as more adaptable software, is an interesting problem that I will return to later.
(In particular, I want to see if there could be a software equivalent of Brand's &#8220;material
that looks bad before it goes bad,&#8221; i.e., a way of building software where the material
warns us about likely imminent structural faults.)</p>

<section>
<p>Whereas the failures of modernist architecture were typically limited to individual buildings,
the failures of modernist urban planning&#8212;rooted in the same principles of rational
planning&#8212;were more high-profile. An iconic example has been a large housing project,
built as part of urban renewal projects, often to replace former slums. The demolition
of one such housing project, Pruitt-Igoe in St Louis, in 1972 has been labelled as the
day modern architecture died by architectural critic Charles Jencks (<a href='#fig_pruitt'>Figure 15</a>).
We can see the housing projects as monumental scale follow-ups to the modernist Isokon building
that I examined earlier&#8212;and the monumental scale, as well as very different socio-economic
conditions, is likely why their fate was different.</p>

<p>The foremost critic to oppose the modernist urban planning was Jane Jacobs. In her 1961 book,
&#8220;The Death and Life of Great American Cities,&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_121'>121</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_121'><sup>121</sup> <a href='#jacobs-1961-cities'>Jacobs (1961)</a></span> Jacobs looked closely at
the street life in Greenwich Village and Boston's North End neighborhood at the time and
documents what makes them work. This includes lively mixed-use, dense population and
&#8220;eyes on the street&#8221;, as well as diversity of buildings and diverse population. That is,
properties that were mostly absent in modernist housing projects. Jacobs' analysis
raises a number of questions about software, some of which I explored
elsewhere such as:<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_122'>122</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_122'><sup>122</sup> <a href='#petricek-2021-architecture'>Petricek (2021)</a></span>
If the rational structure does not produce working software, what are the characteristics
of software and programming systems that actually do it?</p>

<p>One interesting inquiry into the modernist urban planning came James C. Scott who identifies
modernist patterns&#8212;similar to those of modernist urban planning&#8212;in a range of other
areas of society including forestry, agriculture and politics. However, many of the modernist
structures that Scott talks about find some way of working. In Scott's account, this is often
enabled by &#8220;dark twins&#8221;, that is inofficial structures that exist hidden from the official
modernist view that arise &#8220;to perform many of the various needs that the planned institution
fails to fulfill.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_123'>123</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_123'><sup>123</sup> <a href='#scott-1998-state'>Scott (1998, p.261)</a></span> One personification of the concept of dark twin,
documented by Scott is the East German factory worker, touring the country in his Trabant
auto to secure key missing parts not available through official channels, in exchange for
valued goods such as fashionable clothes or champagne, purchased using factory funds.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_124'>124</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_124'><sup>124</sup> <a href='#scott-1998-state'>Scott (1998, p.350)</a></span>

<section>
<p>The idea of dark twins raises a question about software design as well. To parphrase Scott&#8212;to
what extent is successful modernist software design parasitic on similar informal processes that
it cannot create or maintain?<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_125'>125</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_125'><sup>125</sup> <a href='#scott-1998-state'>Scott (1998, p.6)</a></span></p>

<p>I believe one illustration of the above is the type system of the TypeScript language.
(More specifically, I will consider earlier versions of the language. In later versions, the
understanding of types in TypeScript has evolved.) The type system of early TypeScript
featured many types that are common in type systems of more pure languages: primitive types,
object and interface types, function types, union types and generic types. Those are useful
for much of &#8220;modernist&#8221; code that operates on clear and well-defined structures. But not
all code is like that. All programs also need to work with some kind of external data
(<a href='#fig_any'>Figure 16</a>) and this cannot easily be done using purely modernist type system.
TypeScript solved the problem by also including a dark twin&#8212;the <code>any</code> type. The type
breaks the pure modernist properties of the type system (the system cannot guarantee any safety),
but its inclusion was likely crucial for the adoption of TypeScript. The system could actually
be used in practice to work with data and interoperate with the JavaScript ecosystem.</p>

<p>The evolution of the TypeScript type system deserves a further analysis. Later versions
continued adding features that reflected typical (non-modernist) coding patterns
in JavaScript. As the number of dark twins in the system grew, they became integrated into the
official structures of the type system&#8212;so what started as modernist design with the necessary
supporting dark twins may have evolved into a post-modern assemblage.</p>

<h2 id='complexity_and_contradiction_in_software'>Complexity and Contradiction in Software</h2>
<p>The TypeScript story that I hinted at in the previous section may serve as an illustration of an
important fact. In the earlier versions, we could read the language as being based on modernist
design, featuring strong rational type system. There were some unavoidable dark twins, necessary
to make the design practical, but those were only (somewhat) reluctantly admitted. However, the
later versions of TypeScript seem to acknowledge and embrace the complexities and contradictions
inherent in the system, which combines some aspects of initial rational design with the many
complexities of the environment and perhaps also whims of the most recent JavaScript framework
creators.</p>

<p>Should programmers and computer scientists embrace complexity and contradiction in software,
in ways that are similar to those advocated by Robert Venturi for architecture? First, there
is a certain honesty in acknowledging complexity and contradiction in cases where it cannot
be avoided. Venturi himself also does not argue for introducing unnecessary complexity. He says
that &#8220;abstruse architecture is valid when it reflects the complexities and contradictions of
content and meaning.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_126'>126</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_126'><sup>126</sup> <a href='#venturi-1977-complexity'>Venturi (1977, p.25)</a></span> Venturi praises a number of benefits
of working with this fact.</p>

<p>The fact that contradictions support &#8220;richness&#8221; in design (as illustrated by the church in
Dobrá Voda above) is perhaps primarily aesthetical and not necessarily of interest for software
designers. Still, working in an atypical context may serve as a source of inspiration for novel
design. For example, many of the interesting aspects of the Erlang programming langauge arise
from the fact that it was initially designed for telephony applications, which are highly
concurrent, distributed and must be fault tolerant, supporting change &#8220;on the fly&#8221; without
a loss of service during update.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_127'>127</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_127'><sup>127</sup> The motivation behind the design of Erlang and its history
has been documented by <a href='#armstrong-2007-erlang'>Armstrong (2007)</a>.</span></p>

<p>Another interesting observation about complexity made by Venturi is that complexity is robust.
It provides an answer to the criticism of modern design that I mentioned in the previous section.
Whereas &#8220;one foreign element casts into doubt the entire effect of some modern
buildings,&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_128'>128</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_128'><sup>128</sup> <a href='#venturi-1977-complexity'>Venturi (1977, p.42)</a></span> a &#8220;good deal of clutter&#8221; and renovations does not destroy the
Italian urban scene of many times adapted and reconstructed palazzi (<a href='#fig_palazzo'>Figure 17</a>).
This seems to be the case about programming languages too. Consider the C++ language as an
example. &#8220;C++ is complicated, too complicated.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_129'>129</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_129'><sup>129</sup> <a href='#hinnant-2019-iso'>Hinnant et al. (2019, p.5)</a></span>
It also has many &#8220;complicating legacy features.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_130'>130</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_130'><sup>130</sup> <a href='#hinnant-2019-iso'>Hinnant et al. (2019, p.5)</a></span>
Yet, none of those have destroyed the coherence of the language. The language embraces the complexity:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Today, some of the most powerful design techniques combine aspects of traditional object-oriented
programming, aspects of generic programming, aspects of functional programming, and some
traditional imperative techniques. Such combinations, rather than theoretical purity, are the
ideal.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_131'>131</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_131'><sup>131</sup> <a href='#hinnant-2019-iso'>Hinnant et al. (2019)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Although the language designers still strive for coherence, they also acknowledge that
a design &#8220;by a 350+ member committee is unlikely to produce a coherent result.&#8221; But given
the complexity of the ecosystem, there is no way of avoiding this. A  &#8220;mature language needs
dozens or even hundreds of people working on the huge variety of problems that must be
faced.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_132'>132</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_132'><sup>132</sup> <a href='#stroustrup-2020-thriving'>Stroustrup (2020)</a></span> I believe that the
design of C++ has been embracing complexity and contradiction, perhaps for longer than the
designers would admit. But this has made the langauge robust to additions and extensions that
were needed to keep it &#8220;thriving in a crowded and changing world.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_133'>133</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_133'><sup>133</sup> Quoting the

<div class="figure">

<p class='caption'><strong>Figure 18.</strong> Two villas used to illustrate how contradiction can be manifested. Contradiction is
  adapted in Villa Pignatelli (above), and juxtaposed in Villa Palomba (below).</p>
</div>
</section>


<section>
<p>Venturi also identifies two ways in which contradictions can be manifested (<a href='#fig_villas'>Figure 18</a>).
In case of adapted contradiction, the design finds some compromise between the two contradicting
factors, such as by adapting the window mouldings. In case of juxtaposed contradiction, there are
no compromises and, for example, windows appear where the inner layout needs them. The Hotel
Foquet (<a href='#fig_hotel'>Figure 11</a>) was an extreme case of this approach. Venturi contrasts the two
options as follows:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Contradiction adapted is tolerant and pliable. It admits improvisation. It involves the
disintegration of a prototype&#8212;and it ends in approximation and qualification. On the other
hand, contradiction juxtaposed is unbending. It contains violent contrasts and uncompromising
oppositions. Contradiction adapted ends in a whole which is perhaps impure. Contradiction
juxtaposed ends in a whole which is perhaps unresolved.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I believe that we can, again, find examples of both approaches in the domain of programming
language design. Take, for example, the problem of integrating functional programming languages
with the support for side-effects such as performing IO operations. On the one hand, in languages
like OCaml and F#, the contradiction is adapted. Side-effects are tolerated as part of normal
functional programs at a certain cost&#8212;such as the impossibility of making such language lazy.
On the other hand, in languages that rely on monads like Haskell, the contradiction is juxtaposed.
Effectful computations are explicit and their integration is unbending. And whereas the OCaml and
F# design is impure, the Haskell design is unresolved.</p>

<section>
<p>Another interesting aspect of acknowledging and working with complexity is that it can aid
transparency. This can be illustrated using one of Venturi's own projects, documented in the
Complexity and Contradiction book (<a href='#fig_nursehq'>Figure 19</a>). The contradiction that the design
resolves is between the &#8220;complex inside (...) with varieties of spaces and special storage
accommodations&#8221; and &#8220;bold scale and simple form&#8221; of the outside of the building. A trace of
the resolution of the contradiction can be seen in the visible form of the building:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
As for the program complexities of the interior, a hint of the storage intricacies is
confirmed in the alternating recessions of windows and closets in&nbsp;the&nbsp;front.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_134'>134</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_134'><sup>134</sup> <a href='#venturi-1977-complexity'>Venturi (1977, p.109)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if we look at the building front (and perhaps know what we are looking for),
we can see traces of the interior storage spaces in the facade. The building is not trying to
hide the fact behind a simple uniform facade. There is, perhaps, a degree of honesty in the
design, but it also allows us to understand the building and its function better.</p>

<p>I believe that embracing a design which leaves a trace of complexities it resolves is an interesting
option for software and programming systems. As software designers, we are often using abstractions
to hide the internals of a system from its users (or other developers). But such abstractions often
hide contradictions that the implementors had to resolve in some, often imperfect way. If the
abstractions do not leave any hint of such complexities, it is easy to hit their limitations and
use them in a way in which they break. Being able to see through the abstractions&#8212;even if
through limited hints&#8212;may thus be of a practical value.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_135'>135</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_135'><sup>135</sup> The need for constructing
abstractions that can be seen through has been articulated, for example, by <a href='#kartik-2020-mu'>Agaram (2020)</a></span>

<section>
<h2 id='learning_from_software_pop_culture'>Learning from Software Pop Culture</h2>
<p>Venturi's rejection of modernism was based on finding richnes resulting from the complexity and
contradiction in a wide range of historical and vernacular examples of buildings. Learning from Las
Vegas extends the critique, arguing that architects should pay attention to the commercial
vernacular and, generally, the way buildings resulting from the contemporary pop culture are
structured. The architectural inspiration that Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour derive from their
study is that of a decorated shed, a building with simple inner form whose meaning is defined by its
use of signs. I believe we can use both of these concepts&#8212;learning from the pop culture and
the notion of a decorated shed&#8212;to critically examine software and programming systems.</p>

<p>In programming languages and systems, the idea that a programming language can be seen as a
formal mathematical entity was an major invention at the end of the 1950s. It
facilitated the development of many programming languages and concepts, including the influential
Algol language. The consequence of this view was that languages were often designed mainly
with attention to their formal structure and internal coherence (which can be seen as
a combination of modernist view that I discussed above and formalism that I return to later).</p>

<section>
<p>However, a number of more recent programming languages moved away from the strictly modernist or
formalist designs and embraced interaction with the context in which they operate&#8212;or even learn
from the commercial culture and embrace some of their pop symbols. A programming language that
both conceptually and technically fits the notion of a decorated shed is Reason ML.
It was released in 2016 and has been described as:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Reason is not a new language; it's a new syntax and toolchain powered by the battle-tested
language, OCaml. Reason gives OCaml a familiar syntax geared toward JavaScript programmers
(...).<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_136'>136</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_136'><sup>136</sup> <a href='#reasonml-2017-whatandwhy'>Vetter and contributors (2017)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Reason ML provides new syntax and tooling for the existing and much older OCaml language.
Despite numerous advanced aspects, OCaml can be seen as a simple and conventional underlying
structure. However, to produce a language that is more appealing to the intended public&#8212;JavaScript
developers&#8212;the shed is decorated with a new syntax derived from JavaScript. In particular,
Reason ML uses curly brackets and JavaScript-like syntax for comments (<a href='#fig_reason'>Figure 20</a>).
Although there are some technical advantages of the syntax, the main motivation for the
syntactic redecoration is familiarity.</p>

<p>The example of Reason ML shows that the architectural design principle of a decorated shed,
conceived of by Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour can be directly applied in the world of software
too. As with Venturi's first buildings based on the decorated shed idea, Reason ML was received with
mixed reactions. In particular, some saw it as a superficial step backward. But the example also
shows how the design principle lets designers avoid the modernist reinvention of form. Rather than
solving the problem of fit anew, the designers can leverage an existing adequate solution and make
it more appealing for the context that it now needs to exists in.</p>

<p>The concept of a decorated shed can also be linked to a point made by Fred Brooks in his essay
No Silver Bullet, published in 1986, where he argued that:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
There is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself
promises even one order of magnitude improvement in productivity, in reliability, in
simplicity.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_137'>137</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_137'><sup>137</sup> <a href='#brooks-1987-nosilver'>Brooks (1987)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Brooks' argument was based on the analysis of the complexity of software design. He sees it as a
combination of essential complexity, inherent in the problemm and accidental complexity arising
from the imperfection of our processes and tools. Resolving the essential complexity in software
design amounts to achieving fitness between the form and the context. Brooks suggest
some &#8220;promising attacks&#8221; on the problem including, most prominently, &#8220;buy versus build&#8221;:</p>

The most radical possible solution for constructing software is not to construct it at all.

</blockquote>

<p>The development envisioned by Brooks in 1986 has happened in multiple areas. Brooks already
mentioned database systems and spreadsheets. Nowadays, there is a number of pre-existing packages
ranging from e-commerce platforms and accounting software to content management systems.
Many of those systems follow the design principle of a decorated shed in a very literal sense.
For example, content management systems such as WordPress (<a href='#fig_wordpress'>Figure 21</a>) make it
possible to customize the publicly facing look of the system through themes, while the underlying
structure remains the same. (Although, the structure can often also be adapted configured via
plugins.) Again, the decorated shed makes it possible to use an existing adequate strucutre,
but decorate it with symbols and ornaments to communicate thes desired message.</p>

<p>Decorated shed is an intriguing specific design principle that can clearly have implications
for software and programming systems, but we can also consider the more general point
of learning from existing urbanism&#8212;or software ecosystems. After all, Learning from Las Vegas
was intended as &#8220;a study of method, not content.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_139'>139</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_139'><sup>139</sup> <a href='#venturi-1972-learning'>Venturi et al. (1972, p.6)</a></span>
How else can we learn from existing software ecosystems when designing new structures?</p>

<p>I will, again, use TypeScript as my example. Unlike Reason ML, TypeScript is not merely a decorated
shed, but a new language with its own new complexities. As a superset of JavaScript, the language is
derived from an existing structure with complex history. We could analyze this and, for example,
document what kind of richnes emerges from the complexity and when the complexity is adapted or
juxtaposed. (JavaScript and TypeScript mostly seem to follow a concilliatory approach resulting in
adapted complexity.)</p>

<p>However, I want to focus on one aspect of the TypeScript type system design that can be seen as an
example of learning from the pop culture. TypeScript programmers need to interoperate with a large
number of JavaScript libraries. In order to provide type annotations for those libraries,
the type system of TypeScript needs to be expressive enough to cover the scenarios that often
appear in existing libraries. The designers thus need to analyze existing practices and libraries,
many of which emerged without much concern for programming language or type system design.
<a href='#fig_tstypes'>Figure 22</a> provides two examples. The first code snippet shows how TypeScript
overloading made it possible to provide a typed interface for the <code>createElement</code> function,
which returns a different kind of object depending on the value of the first parameter
(and which predates TypeScript by some 15 years). The snippet combines string literal types
(treating a string value as a type) and overloading.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_140'>140</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_140'><sup>140</sup> The specific snippet comes from the
source code of TypeScript 2.0, but the features existed in earlier version. In later versions of
TypeScript, the same is achieved using <code>keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap</code> instead.</span>
The second snippet uses template literal types, which make it possible to construct string literal
types through templates. Here, the feature is used to define type for a range of valid CSS class
names that the external library, Tailwind, defines.</p>

<section>
<p>To what extent is it fitting to see JavaScript libraries as a commercial pop culture of Las Vegas
may be open to discussion. The more important point here is the design methodology that
language designers need to use if they are creating a language to fit with an existing
complex and contradictory ecosystem. As noted by Venturi and his co-authors,
&#8220;analysis of existing American urbanism (...) teaches us architects to be more
understanding and less authoritarians in the plans we make (...).&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_141'>141</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_141'><sup>141</sup> <a href='#venturi-1972-learning'>Venturi et al. (1972, p.6)</a></span>
In the same way, understanding and learning from what exists in existing software ecosystems
that programming languages interact with teaches programming langauge designers to be
less authoritarian and and adapt (or juxtapose!) their designs with respect to this context.</p>

<p>The analysis of existing context and culture can be done in a number of ways and result in
a range of designs. To some extent, the design of JavaScript still aims at the modernist maxim
&#8220;less is more&#8221;. For example, it resolves the complexity of the <code>createElement</code> typing
using otherwise useful and reusable constructs (overloading and string literals) rather than
through ad-hoc mechanism. But the complexity of the ecosystem in which it exists forces it to
often adopt the post-modernist approach &#8220;less is a bore&#8221;.</p>

<p>An even more modernist approach to learning
from the preexisting context can be illustrated by various attempts to base the design of a
programming language on empirical observations of programmers, or the analysis of existing code
in large software repositories such as GitHub.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_142'>142</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_142'><sup>142</sup> An example that also illustrates the
difficulty of this endeavor is the work by <a href='#berger-2019-impact'>Berger et al. (2019)</a>. A broader discussion
on research methodology by <a href='#church-2023-humancentric'>Church and Blackwell (2023)</a> can be seen as a criticism of
modernist approaches to the design of programming languages.</span> Such over-reliance on facts
is the starting point for Peter Eisenman's doctoral work. Eisenman presents his objection
using a reference to earlier witings of American historian Carl L. Becker:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Becker describes the modern climate of opinion as factual rather than
rational (...). For Becker, history, the question of facts and how they are related,
has replaced reason and logic, the question of `why?'<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_143'>143</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_143'><sup>143</sup> <a href='#eisenman-2006-formal'>Eisenman (2006, p.11)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the next section, I will move from the factual approaches&#8212;be it the modernist analysis
of context or post-modernist reading of contemporary culture and its symbols&#8212;to software and
programming systems designs that employ rational analyses based on reason and logic.</p>

<h2 id='emergence_from_formal_structures'>Emergence from Formal Structures</h2>
<p>
At the first sight, the formal structures designed by Peter Eisenman seem similar to modernist
architecture (<a href='#fig_wtc'>Figure 23</a>) and some of his critics saw his focus on formalism and
abstraction as a return to outdated modernist ideals. As I illustrated through a number of examples
earlier, Eisenman works with simple formal modernist structures, but he uses them for a different
purpose than modernist architects. His project for the World Trade Center memorial, for
example, turns the horizontal Manhattan grid into a vertical one, using a rational modernist
structure as a formal entity.</p>

<p>Eisenman's approach, apparent already in The Formal Basis of Modern Architecture is to work
with basic geometric structures such as the grid, mass, volumes and surfaces&#8212;and to see how
they interact in order to form a building. A computer scientist reading his thesis can easily
read the work as defining a domain-specific langauge for describing architectural structures.
The language is formed of primitives and combinators that can be used to put the primitives
together. The important point, however, is that the basic structures are geometrical and rooted
in analysis of abstract architectural forms. They do not arise from analysis of function.</p>

<p>As discussed earlier, I believe the most direct software counterparts to basic architectural
structures are formal models of computation such as the lambda calculus and Turing machines.
It is also fitting that these two specific models existed in the domain of formal logic before
the first digital electronic computers and programming languages. They are thus not modernist
abstractions, resulting from the analysis of the function of software, but a priori structures
of computation. The two models can be contrasted with formal models of parallel and concurrent
systems such as Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) developed in the
1970s,<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_144'>144</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_144'><sup>144</sup> <a href='#hoare-1978-csp'>Hoare (1978)</a>; For a broader historical context and origins of the
work, see the history documented by <a href='#baeten-2005-process'>Baeten (2005)</a>.</span>
which were derived from existing programming patterns. For example, Hoare explicitly notes
that his notion of a process &#8220;may constitute a synthesis of a number of familiar and new
programming ideas.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_145'>145</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_145'><sup>145</sup> <a href='#hoare-1978-csp'>Hoare (1978)</a></span></p>

<p>To keep the software examples as close to the architectural ones, we can look for formal
structures that describe some aspect of computation or program structure, but are not conceived
as models of existing practical programming languages. An interesting question to ask is how
those structures resolve the problem of achieving fit between the form and the context. Does the
fit emerge as (perhaps) an accidental effect of the use of formal structures? Or does the use
of autonomous formal structures result in &#8220;unlivable&#8221; buildings, as critics of Eisenman
occasionally like to point out?</p>

<p>If we see the lambda calculus as the formal structure that underpins functional programming
languages, then there are certainly many domains where the emergent form fits with a context.
Functional list processing, which inspired LINQ and Java Streams, would be only one such example.
This claim necessitates some caution, though. The Lisp language, often regarded
as the first functional programming language was not directly based on the lambda calculus.
Its author, John McCarthy &#8220;was aware of [the lambda calculus] but had not studied
it.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_146'>146</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_146'><sup>146</sup> <a href='#turner-2013-fp'>Turner (2013)</a></span> The specific
example of functional list processing also does not require nearly the full power (or even the
key structures) of the lambda calculus.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_147'>147</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_147'><sup>147</sup> The data exploration calculus
(<a href='#petricek-2020-foundations'>Petricek, 2020</a>) is an example of a very limited language that still supports
functional collection processing.</span></p>

<p>Later functional programming languages, including most notably Haskell, have the lambda
calculus as a more direct predecessor. The popularity and non-negligible industrial adoption
of Haskell shows that a formal structure can give rise to a well-fitting form.
But again, some caution is needed. As the earlier analysis of the esoteric programming language
Unlambda suggests, the good fit may not necessarily be the result of the underlying formal
structure, but a result of a pragmatic resolution of the remaining design problems.</p>

<p>Another source of formal structures that have been used as the basis for programming
abstractions, especially within functional programming, is category theory. Category theory
is a branch of abstract mathematics concerned with general structures and their relations.
As such, it perfectly fits the bill of being a source of generic forms that can be applied
to understand and design software structures.</p>

<p>The most prominent categorical structure that found its use in programming
is a monad. Initially used to formally model the semantics of effectful computations in a
functional language, monads were later implemented in Haskell alongside with the
<code>do</code> notation for working with them. The abstraction was adopted for a number of
use cases, including handling of input and output, which &#8220;has always appeared to be one of
the less satisfactory features of purely functional languages.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_148'>148</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_148'><sup>148</sup> <a href='#spj-1993-imperative'>Peyton&#32;Jones and Wadler (1993)</a></span>
A quote from the paper that introduces monadic input/output recognizes the good fit
that emerged from the use of the formal structure:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
This paper outlines a new approach [for input/output in lazy functional languages]
based on monads (...). We do not claim any fundamental expressiveness or efficiency
which is not obtainable through existing systems (...). Nevertheless we feel
that the entire system works particularly smoothly as a whole, from the standpoint
of both programmer and implementor.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_149'>149</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_149'><sup>149</sup> <a href='#spj-1993-imperative'>Peyton&#32;Jones and Wadler (1993)</a></span></p>

<p class='caption'><strong>Figure 25.</strong> Eisenman's House VI (1975) is generated using a small number of formal operations.</p>

</section>


<section>
<p>The example shown in <a href='#fig_monads'>Figure 24</a> uses monads and the <code>do</code> notation to
implement a simple program that reads a number of lines from the input and prints them back
to the user. The example is intentionally chosen to require a number of monadic structures.
It uses the <code>forM</code> function to iteratively execute function that reads input,
<code>forM_</code> to print outputs (a version with underscore ignores the results),
and it uses three <code>do</code> blocks to sequence imperative operations. In this particular
example, the formal structure of a monad permeates the entire program. (Contrast the example
with more recent approach to handling input/output effects based on algebraic effect handlers
where constructs such as iteration are not affected by the effects.)</p>

<p>To question the design of monadic input/output, we can compare the computer program design
generated through a formal structure (monads) with architecture generated through a formal
structure. Consider the House VI designed by Peter Eisenman:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
House VI was in fact the result of the application of a few limited rules
(displacement, rotation, compression and extension), to a restricted number of
elements (volume, vertical layers and the nine square grid). All these operations
produced several diagrams, whose relevance replaced the notions of materiality,
function, and meaning.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_150'>150</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_150'><sup>150</sup> <a href='#corbo-2020-eisenman'>Corbo (2020, p.33)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The consequences of the design methodology are apparent in <a href='#fig_upsidedown'>Figure 25</a>.
Some of the beams in the house play no structural role, but are present for merely formal
reasons. This includes the column hanging over a dining table. Another artifact generated
by the design method is the inverted red staircase, which hints at the fact that the house
may well continue to function if it was flipped upside down. Rather than achieving a fit between
the form and the context, the house sends a message:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
As annoying as the house was to inhabit, Eisenman was able to constantly
remind the users of the architecture around them and how it affects
their&nbsp;lives.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_151'>151</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_151'><sup>151</sup> <a href='#perez-2010-housevi'>Perez (2010)</a></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The use of monads for input/output in Haskell is certainly not as annoying. After all, the
authors praised the system for working &#8220;particularly smoothly&#8221; when introducing the idea.
However, the use of monads as a formal structure to generate library designs in functional
programming languages has also found its critics, myself included. In &#8220;What we talk about when we
talk about monads&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_152'>152</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_152'><sup>152</sup> <a href='#petricek-2018-monads'>Petricek (2018)</a></span> I pointed out that &#8220;there are a number of cases where monads
were used in an academic paper and their use was later revised or avoided.&#8221;
Interestingly, some of those undesirable uses of monads are not unlike the undesirable effects
that the use of formal structures generates in Eisenman's House VI.</p>

<p>The first example is that of monadic parser combinators. Parser combinators
emerged as a functional and compositional way to construct parsers. When it turned out that
parsers can match the structure of a monad, most implementations of parser combinators
started to follow this formal structure. However, the structure implied by monads was often
not practically necessary&#8212;it was the result of formal decision, rather than a decision
arising from the required functionality. In contrast to parser combinators that were not based
on monads, monadic parser combinators were also less efficient and had poor error reporting.
In some way, monadic parser combinators are not unlike the formally appealing, but practically
unnecessary columns in Eisenman's House IV.</p>

<p>The second example is the use of monads for capturing dataflow computations. As pointed out
by Dominic Orchard,<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_153'>153</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_153'><sup>153</sup> <a href='#orchard-2011-comonad'>Orchard (2011)</a></span> computer scientists initially tried to model dataflow
computations using the formal structure of a monad. Later work argued that this cannot be done
and instead proposed to use a formally dual structure of a comonad. Although the desired
implementation could, to some extent, fit both of the structures, it later turned out that
other aspects of the model (such as how easy it is to use it in formal reasoning) are
easier to achieve with the dual structure. What the example suggests is that there are
unexpected properties of formal structures whose practical implications may remain
ununderstood. Perhaps Eisenman's House IV would, indeed, work better if it was flipped upside-down,
as eventually happened with formal models of dataflow computations?</p>

<p>The conclusion we can draw from these examples is the same for architecture and
for computer science and programming. In the case of modernism, the problem was the difficulty
of fully understanding the context. In the case of formalism, we instead opt for a design
methodology taht disregards the context. Formal structures have a great appeal and
many useful structures can emerge as the result of formal manipulation. But there is no
guarantee that they will result in a good fit between the form and the context.</p>

<p>I opened this text with a reference to Christopher Alexander's OOPSLA 1996 keynote where he
wondered if programmers and computer scientists are willing to act as &#8220;guns for hire&#8221;.
He continued his presentations with an invitation:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
What I am proposing here is something a little bit different from that. It is a view of
programming as the natural genetic infrastructure of a living world which you/we are
capable of creating, managing, making available, and which could then have the result that a
living structure in our towns, houses, work places, cities, becomes an attainable thing.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the (almost) 30 years since his presentation, software has indeed became a kind of genetic
infrastructure of a living world, although not always in the most desirable ways&#8212;to use
Alexander's terminology, software has not always provided us with living structures.
Alexander's lifetime work has been concerned with understanding living structures and finding
ways of creating them. My own interest in this text is way more&nbsp;modest.</p>

<p>I think we need a richer critical language for thinking about software. When we critically
examine software today, we most frequently approach it from one of two perspectives.
The first perspective is technical. Does the software work as it was intended to? Even if
most software built today is not developed according to an up-front specification, the technical
perspective is still concerned with its functionality. In the case of more abstract systems
like programming languages, we still ask technical questions, such as how effectively they support
different use cases. The second perspective is social. What is the effect that the software has on
the society and individuals? In response, much has been written about algorithmic bias, exploitation
of personal data or the role of social media.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_154'>154</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_154'><sup>154</sup> <a href='#oneil-2016-weapons'>O'Neil (2016)</a>, <a href='#noble-2018-algorithms'>Noble (2018)</a>, <a href='#zuboff-2019-capitalism'>Zuboff (2019)</a>, <a href='#tufekci-2017-twitter'>Tufekci (2017)</a></span></p>

<p>I believe that the two disconnected perspectives are insufficient for critical thinking about

Intelligence&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_155'>155</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_155'><sup>155</sup> <a href='#russell-2015-letter'>Russell et al. (2015)</a></span> (<a href='#fig_ai'>Figure 26</a>). The introduction of the letter talks
about the impact of AI on society and the letter lists multiple social science questions (policy,
economics, ethics). The computer science priorities are highly technical problems like security,
control and the classic problem of &#8220;how to prove that a system satisfies certain desired formal
properties&#8221;. Notably absent from the letter is a call for closer integration between the
two perspectives of looking at the system. What I am interested in is finding ways
of engaging with the technical structure of software, but not through technical questions.</p>

<p>I have been using architectural theory as an inspiration for ideas on the critical language
of software&#8212;partly because of the existing connection between the disciplines, but also
because of the rich literature concerned with critical reading of architecture.
In 1977, Jorge Silvetti described an emerging critical discourse within architectural theory that
he calls &#8220;criticism from within&#8221; and which complements existing
approaches:<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_156'>156</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_156'><sup>156</sup> <a href='#silvetti-1998-shadows'>Silvetti (1998, p.372)</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
[The] &#8220;realm&#8221; of criticism has traditionally been divided between two opposing modes: one
that tries to evaluate the degree of &#8220;fitness&#8221; or &#8220;`non-fitness&#8221; of a solution
to a particular architectural question and another that attempts to see both the question and
that solution as parts of a larger historical, cultural, or ideological process.

<section>
<p>The two opposing modes of criticism identified by Silvetti are remarkably like the two critical
ways of looking at software. Post-modern architecture that emerged in the late 1960s brought with
it a new critical discourse. The new &#8220;criticism from within&#8221; had a range of forms and
aspects, many of which were discussed in detail by Silvetti in 1977. Those include the idea of
treating architecture as a language that can be subjected to analysis and manipulation.
Inspired by Chomsky, we can study the syntax of the language; inspired by French structuralists,
we can study the systems of signs employed by the architectural language.
Using figures of classical rhetoric, Silvetti gives examples of buildings that &#8220;all operate
with known architectural codes, and they all redeploy these codes by effecting some easily
perceivable changes.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_157'>157</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_157'><sup>157</sup> <a href='#silvetti-1998-shadows'>Silvetti (1998, p.376)</a></span> The changes introduce figures such as hyperboles,
paradoxes, ironies and ellipses (<a href='#fig_vanna'>Figure 27</a>).</p>

<p>Silvetti analyses the new &#8220;criticism from within&#8221; in terms of a metalanguage that is
used to talk about the language of architecture. A text that comments on a building would be
an example of such metalanguage. What the new &#8220;criticism from within&#8221; brought is
&#8220;the very special case of metalanguage in which both discourses belong to the same practice;
architecture commenting on architecture, architecture `speaking' of itself.&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_158'>158</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_158'><sup>158</sup> <a href='#silvetti-1998-shadows'>Silvetti (1998, p.376)</a></span>
This is the idea that I developed in the first two parts of this text&#8212;the possibility of
using software and programming systems as a metalanguage for commenting on software and
programming systems. The different critiques that Silvetti discusses in his analysis differ
based on what codes of the underlying architectural langauge they refer to, including
formal, functional and moral codes. I believe we can imagine similar critique of software
that highlights one of those aspects of the system it comments on.</p>

<h2 id='possibility_of_a_critical_language'>Possibility of a Critical Language</h2>
<p>Many of the ideas presented in this text are the result of my search for a critical
language of software. In the preceding pages, I regularly discussed an architectural idea and
looked for ways in which a similar point can be (or has been) made about software. To translate
critical ideas into the world of software, it is useful to reflect on the general mechanism
through which the critical langauge of architecture works. To what extent are software and
programming systems like architecture&#8212;and can be subjected to the
same kind of criticism&#8212;and to what extent do they differ?</p>

<p>Charles Jencks opens his book &#8220;The Story of Post-Modernism&#8221;<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_159'>159</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_159'><sup>159</sup> <a href='#jencks-2012-postmodernism'>Jencks (2012)</a></span> with an answer to
a question asking what is a typical post-modern building. It is useful to quote the answer at length,
because it illustrates two key mechanisms at work in post-modern buildings:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
[Typical post-modern building is one]
that is hybrid, one that dramatizes the mixture of opposing periods&#8212;the past, present and
future&#8212;to create a miniature `time-city'. Hence it is based on multiple codes, combing Modern
universal technology and local culture, in a recognizable `double-coding', its characteristic
style. The typical Post-Modern building speaks on several levels at once, to high and low culture,
and acknowledges the global situation where no single culture can speak for the entire world.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Jencks then illustrates the idea using James Stirling's post-modern addition to the Neue
Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart (<a href='#fig_stuttgart'>Figure 28</a>):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Its double-coding mixes Modern elements with traditional and vernacular ones, three styles
sometimes compete on one facade. But the irony is that Stirling uses High-Tech decoratively,
to tell the visitor how to move through this complex site. Brightly coloured steel is thus used
as symbolic ornament while traditional masonry works best as temperature control:
such inversions in Post-Modernism always make you smile with their knowing irony.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What is needed of software or programming system to read the multiple codes present in a post-modern
system and make you smile with knowing irony? The key difficulty is that buildings have many
ways through which they can express meaning that is immediately visible to anyone who encounters
the building. Three styles on one facade, brightly coloured steel, false arches, upside-down
stairs or broken columns are all visible external features of a building that you can see
when you visit a museum or enter a house.</p>

<section>
<p>In contrast to architecture, most software is opaque. When you encounter it, you are typically
exposed only to its functional aspects. Software systems have user interface that can be styled
in various ways. Such styling can be used to make some ironical statements, such as by rendering
a serious web site in a style resembling the typical Geocities design (<a href='#fig_geocitiesizer'>Figure 29</a>),
but this use is typically limited to toy projects and has only limited expressive power.
A contemporary art gallery would not likely comission a software artist to create a contradictory,
critical or ironic web page for it. (Though, perhaps it should do exactly this!)</p>

<p>It is worth noting that user interface is not just the visual aspect (styling) of the software
system, but also the patterns of interaction that it supports. The &#8220;worst practice UI experiment&#8221;
User Inyerface (<a href='#fig_inyerface'>Figure 10</a>) discussed earlier consists mostly of components with a
standard look, but uses them in distorted ways. More generally, the double coding can leverage
the fact that there are certain established user interface patterns for certain kinds of services.
Social media use a timeline, online shopping sites use a catalog with features such as filtering,
a search engine prompts for a query, a file browser displays folders and documents, and so on.
Using an established user interface pattern for a task it was not inteded or designed for can
thus be used as a form of double coding. (Digital platforms for child adoption in the US
studied by Isabelle Higgins are an alarming inadvertent example of this. The fact that the
platforms adopt the structure of online shopping sites leads to a &#8220;bizarre and depressing process
of catalogue shopping&#8221; for children eligible for adoption.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_160'>160</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_160'><sup>160</sup> <a href='#higgins-2024-children'>Higgins (2024)</a></span>
Perhaps the same double coding mechanism can be used intentionally and in a beneficial way.</p>

<section>
<p>The opposite extreme, in contrast to looking at the user interface, is to look at the software
source code. This view is typically only accessible to experts, but it offers other interesting
possibilities of employing double coding. On the one hand, the program source code is
understood by the computer, which can execute the instructions (or, more precisely, the
compiler or an interpreter). On the other hand, the source code can be read by a human, who
interprets it, often through broader cultural associations.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways through which source code can express meaning to a human that is
inaccessible to the computer. This includes aspects such as code formatting, variable naming
and comments. Software engineers typically use those devices to aid program comprehension --
and so the meaning intended for the human reader matches the meaning intended for the
computer, possibly providing additional motivation or context. However, it can also be
used in ironical ways to confuse the reader (<a href='#fig_pi'>Figure 30</a>) or for artistic
purposes.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_161'>161</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_161'><sup>161</sup> As an example, see the <code>./code --poetry</code> book (<a href='#holden-2023-code'>Holden and Kerr, 2023</a>).</span>
The semantic flexibility also gives code aesthetical qualities that have been used for different
purposes and are judged differently by different readers.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_162'>162</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_162'><sup>162</sup> Explored in a PhD thesis by
<a href='#depaz-2023-aesthetics'>Depaz (2023)</a>. The topic is a subject of other critical code studies works

<p>At a higher-level of abstraction, we may be able to find double-coding in the internal structure
of software. Here, I refer to software aspects such as architecture (is it microservice-based,
monolithic, composed of different layers and components), as well as data structures used
(to what degree is there a fixed structure for the data and relationships).<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_163'>163</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_163'><sup>163</sup> An example
given by <a href='#jakubovic-2023-phd'>Jakubovic (2023)</a>: &#8220;Consider a game in which the class <code>Goblin</code> is a
sub-class of <code>Enemy</code>. In a language like C++, class relationships are statically enforced.
This prevents the player from befriending Goblins later in the game, as we cannot write code to
change a <code>Goblin</code> instance to inherit from <code>Friend</code> at an appropriate point during run time.&#8221;</span>
Those aspects are typically hidden from the user and are not always easy to reconstruct even for
a programmer. However, a system that would make such structure more apparent (just like Centre
Pompidou exposes its infrastructure) could use it to express meaning.</p>

<p>It may be that our ability to use double coding and irony in the design of typical software
systems is limited. There is only so much that we can say through the user interface and
interaction patterns and there are only so many people who will venture to investigate the source
code. However, there certainly are kinds of software systems that have greater expressive powers.
This is why the focus of this text has often been on programming languages and systems.
As we have seen, a programming language can exhibit double coding and irony in a range of ways,
ranging from the choice of features (combining contradictory formal structures) to the use of
syntax with particular association (adding a popular syntax to a non-mainstream language).</p>

</section>


<section>
<h2 id='transparency_and_methodological_freedom'>Transparency and Methodological Freedom</h2>
<p>To provide a tentative conclusion, I believe that the world of software and programming systems
desparately needs two things. The first is a greater transparency. It should be possible to see
inside software systems to a much greater degree. This will let users understand (and perhaps
even change) how software works, but it would also enable more active critical discourse
about software. The second is methodological freedom. Many interesting architectural ideas
first emerged in more experimental contexts and, perhaps, if we were building software not
only for immediate practical commercial use, we would be able to come up with innovative software
structures.</p>

<p>There are already systems that hint at how the greater transparency may look, but for one reason
or another, they have not achieved their ultimate objectives. The free software manifesto argues
for the &#8220;freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you
wish&#8221;.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_164'>164</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_164'><sup>164</sup> <a href='#stallman-1984-fsf'>Stallman (1984)</a></span> This may have been the case about free software in the 1980s when
most users were also C programmers. Today, in practice, even if you are using free software,
you have a little chance of understanding how it works, much less changing it, due to its
complexity.</p>

<p>Programming systems and environments based on Smalltalk provide greater transparency thanks to
the fact that program execution is not distinct from the programming environment. As such, the
user of an application can inspect the structure of the system and navigate to the source code.
The Smalltalk designers imagined that users would start by using existing applications, but then
gradually learn how to tweak and adapt them, create new ones and even modify the system
itself.<sup class='noteref'><a href='#note_165'>165</a></sup><span class='note' id='note_165'><sup>165</sup> <a href='#reenskaug-1981-smalltalk'>Reenskaug (1981)</a></span>
Although Smalltalk inspired virtually all modern object-oriented langugages, very few of them
retained this ability.</p>

<p>Finally, the 1990s era of web also afforded greater transparency. As discussed above, it was
possible to view source code of existing web pages, extract interesting JavaScript snippets and
reuse them. This supported the rise of the creative vernacular web. However, modern web applications
are nothing like this. Their source code and internal structure is hidden&#8212;partly to protect
intellectual property and partly for engineering reasons (large modern web applications are
composed of components that are compiled together and minimized for efficiency).</p>

<p>I do not know how to make modern software development transparent in the sense in which it
was transparent in the early days of free software, object-oriented programming and the
web, but I'm convinced that this is something that we need in order to create software that
serves its users&#8212;and also to create software that supports self-reflective
critical discourse about software.</p>

<p>The second thing that I argued for is greater methodological freedom. If we try to express
software critique only through regular, commercial software systems built with a tight budget,
we are inevitably bound to fail. Or, rather, what we can &#8220;say&#8221; through such software
will be very limited. It seems that buildings have greater potential for double-coding and
expressivity than software, but it is not an accident that many of the examples I mentioned
throughout this text were not ordinary commercial buildings with tight budget. (An exception
from the rule would be Venturi's Guild House, which combined ordinary form with decorative
historical references. The economy of the project, built as a &#8220;decorated shed&#8221;,
was a notable part of Venturi's critique of modernist architecture.)</p>

<p>The examples that were featured prominently as my references included museums, public buildings,
pavilions, parks, monuments, luxurious villas, but also unrealized plans for buildings
and, notably, projects that had the structure of an architectural plan, but were never
intended to be realized. All of those provided additional room for criticism than an
ordinary commercial building would. Perhaps, if we want to express critical ideas through
software, we also need to do so through special kinds of software.</p>

<p>What if the critique of the closed nature of software came in the form of a radically open
and accessible public service software? What if technical documentation for a fictional
operating system illustrated an alternative to the system consisting of isolated inflexible
apps? What if we celebrated landmark programming systems and their creators by questioning
their design decisions, say by creating an irregular freeform spreadsheets?</p>
