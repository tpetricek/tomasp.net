        <h1>The Gamma and Digital News Innovation Fund</h1>
<p>Last year, I wrote a bit about my interest in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/thegamma/">building programming tools for data
journalism</a>. Data journalism might sound like a niche
field, but that is not the case if we talk about data-driven storytelling more generally,</p>
<a href="https://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/dni-logo.png" style="width:400px" class="rdecor"/>
</a>
<p>In programming, your outcome is typically some application that does stuff. In data science,
your outcome is very often a report or a <em>story</em> that aims to influence people's behavior or
company decisions. No matter whether you are a journalist writing an article about government
spending or an analyst producing internal sales reports, you are <em>telling stories with data</em>.</p>
<p>Being able to tell stories with data (but also verify and assess other people's stories that
can be backed by data) is becoming a vital skill in the modern world, which is partly why I find
this topic extremely important and interesting. But to do this currently, you need to be a
skilled programmer, great designer and good storyteller, all at the same time!</p>
<p>I have not written about this topic much over the last year (mainly because I was busy
with <a href="http://tomasp.net/coeffects">Coeffects</a>, <a href="http://www.fsharpconf.com">fsharpConf</a>,
<a href="http://fslab.org">FsLab</a> and <a href="http://www.fsharpworks.com">fsharpWorks</a>), but this will be
changing - I'm very happy to announce that my data-journalism related project
<a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma</a> has been awarded funding from the <a href="https://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/fund/">DNI Innovation
Fund</a> and I'll be working on it over the next year
at the <a href="https://turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> in London.</p>
<h2>Why is data-driven storytelling hard</h2>
<p>A nice recent example of data-driven storytelling is the New York Times story
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/08/sports/olympics/history-olympic-dominance-charts.html">A Visual History of Which Countries Have Dominated the Summer
Olympics</a>.
It uses data to tell an interesting history - but it also uses an elegant visualization that makes you
immediately wonder about a number of aspects of the history (what happened in the two gaps and what are
the two spikes in 1980s). It is also a fairly typical example of how hard it is to build a good data-driven
story (and not many can match the work of New York Times).</p>
<div class="wdecor">
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/08/sports/olympics/history-olympic-dominance-charts.html">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/nyt-olympics.png" class="img-responsive"/>
</a>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/08/sports/olympics/history-olympic-dominance-charts.html">
A Visual History of Which Countries Have Dominated the Summer Olympics
</a> - New York Times
</div>
<p>There is a number of reasons why doing something like the above New York Times data analysis and
visualization is far from easy. The concrete example illustrates this quite clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Getting the data in the first place - The New York Times article quotes <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com">Sports
Reference</a> as the source, but it is not clear how exactly they
got the data. Sports Reference seems to have data for individual Olympic games in <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/2012/">reasonable HTML
tables</a>
that you could scrape. It does not have data for Rio 2016, so you'd need to scrape
<a href="https://www.rio2016.com/en/medal-count-athletes">Rio 2016 results</a> and match slightly different
naming of disciplines...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The neat visualization you can see above is a <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060954">D3 Streamgraph</a>,
so once you have the data (downloaded using, say, Python) you'll need to write some JavaScript
to build the visualization. This typically involves modifying existing samples, because writing
D3 from scratch is fairly hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you scroll down on the New York Times visualization page, you'll find a number of other
variations on the visualization that display medals by different disciplines. You'll probably
need to write some more code to partition the data by disciplines - and even then, you cannot
easily let the reader choose which disciplines they're interested in, because that would involve
turning the static page into (even harder to create) interactive visualization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Gamma project proposal</h2>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/gamma-logo.png" style="width:160px" class="rdecor" />
<p>For some time now, I was thinking that building such data-driven stories should be easier with a
more advanced programming language and library support. Most programming tools have been created by
programmers for programmers - and we often miss many great usability ideas that come from
different worlds like <a href="https://vimeo.com/145492419">Excel and spreadsheet programming</a>.</p>
<p>I will be writing more about this over the next few months, starting with my most recent work on
<a href="http://rio2016.thegamma.net/">Visualizing Olympic Medalists</a>, but I wanted to start by sharing the
important parts of my DNI Innovation Fund application - the short summary of what I will be working
on is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Increasing number of journalists back their stories with data available through open government
data efforts, international organizations and citizen initiatives. The typical way of using
such data involves a number of manual steps – a data journalist might download the data using a
web browser, filter it using a spreadsheet application, produce a chart and embed the result in
an article as an image. Such articles suffer from a number of issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are error-prone (it is easy to make mistakes when processing data by hand)</li>
<li>They are not transparent (readers cannot verify what data is used and how)</li>
<li>They limit further exploration (readers cannot modify the article to explore other features)</li>
</ol>
<p>Those issues arise from one key problem: the link between the article and the original data source
is lost during the process. The aim of The Gamma Project is to create open tools that help data
journalists back stories with data in a way that keeps the link between the article and the
data sources. This will make data journalism more transparent and reproducible, but also more
engaging for the reader as it allows new kinds of interactions with articles and data behind them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the original proposal was mainly focused on openness and reproducibility. I expect
that this will still be the main part, but I would also like to work more on usability (making the
tools easier to use for non-programmers) and I recently got interested in making interactive
visualizations easier (more declarative and compositional).</p>
<h2>What makes the project innovative</h2>
<p>The next question in the DNI Innovation Fund application was <em>"What makes the project innovative?"</em>
I think there is a number of reasons why there is no tool that would make the above possible.
Perhaps most importantly, much of programming language research focuses on <em>programs</em>. We create
type systems that can check program correctness, we wonder about better ways of structuring
programs and so on.</p>
<p>In data journalism (and data science generally), much of the work is done in a scripting mode and
so we need to focus more on <em>interaction</em>. And as I said before, the end result is not a program,
but a <em>story</em>. The technical ideas that I plan to incorporate in The Gamma project (as outlined
in the project proposal) are below.</p>
<h3>Articles are text with calculations</h3>
<p>The first innovative aspect of the project is that it treats data-driven articles as text with
code. This key principle lets us create open and reproducible content, but it also means that we
can use a range of program analysis methods for the benefit of transparent data journalism. For
example, provenance tracking methods can be used to automatically generate data citations for each
article.</p>
<h3>Type providers for data access</h3>
<p>The most important technological innovation that makes it possible to effortlessly access the
plethora of open data sources will be based on the concept of <em>type providers</em> (indeed, the
<a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/WorldBank.html">World Bank type provider</a> was one
of the things that made me think about data journalism in the first place). A type provider
integrates external data sources as first-class components of a programming language. Together
with modern editor tooling, user can navigate through data and use it in their program similarly
to the way they navigate through directory structure in a file system.</p>
<h3>Modern editor tooling</h3>
<p>Modern software development environments (IDEs) provide a range of assistance to software
developers when writing code including auto-completion and advanced navigation and search tools.
However, those are rarely available in tools used by data journalists. In The Gamma Project, we
aim to make such tooling available to data journalists, specifically focusing on problems that
are important when building data-driven articles. In The Gamma Project, auto-completion and
navigation tools will provide help when finding relevant data across multiple open data sources.</p>
<h3>New kind of data-driven articles</h3>
<p>To our best knowledge no existing publication provides the degree of openness that we envision for
the articles created using The Gamma Project. Only a small number of media outlets publish source
code for their articles (e.g. New York Times Upshot), but none of them make it a part of the article
itself and aim to make it such that the reader can understand the analysis and reproduce the results
without significant programming experience. We believe that the new kind of data-driven articles
advocated by The Gamma can be an essential part towards increasing data literacy of the general
public.</p>
<h3>Novel user experiences</h3>
<p>A more pragmatic innovation is that The Gamma articles enable novel kinds of user interactions,
thus producing more engaging content for the readers. Based on the program analysis, we can
automatically expose user interface for changing parameters of the data analysis (say, compare
most expensive streets in a city, choosing the initial display based on the reader’s location).
This will allow the readers to explore aspects of the data that they would not otherwise have
access to. Furthermore, we intend to allow readers to share their perspectives on data, providing
data backed commenting.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>If you are interested in The Gamma project, you can follow it at
<a href="http://twitter.com/thegamma_net">@thegamma_net</a> on Twitter and you can also find more
information on <a href="http://thegamma.net/">thegamma.net</a>, which also still hosts the <a href="http://prototype.thegamma.net/carbon">one year
old prototype</a> that I <a href="tomasp.net/blog/2015/thegamma/">wrote about last
year</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYoO2RvZn7Y">talked about at Strange
Loop</a>.</p>
<p>You can also expect more news <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/">on this blog</a>. In particular,
I will be writing about the project I did on <a href="http://rio2016.thegamma.net/">Visualizing Olympic
Medalists</a> - this is an early version showing some of the
ideas of what I'd like to build as part of The Gamma (with all source code available
<a href="https://github.com/the-gamma">on GitHub</a>)</p>
