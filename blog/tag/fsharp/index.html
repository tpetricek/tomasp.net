    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/write-your-own-excel/">Write your own Excel in 100 lines of F#</a></h1>
    <p>I've been teaching F# for over seven years now, both in the public F# FastTrack course that we run
at SkillsMatter in London and in various custom trainings for private companies. Every time I teach
the F# FastTrack course, I modify the material in one way or another. I wrote about some of this
interesting history <a href="#">last year in an fsharpWorks article</a>. The course now has a stable half-day
introduction to the language and a stable focus on the ideas behind functional-first programming,
but there are always new examples and applications that illustrate this style of programming.</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/write-your-own-excel/logo.png" class="rdecor" />
<p>When we started, we mostly focused on teaching functional programming concepts that might be useful
even if you use C# and on building analytical components that your could integrate into a larger
.NET solution. Since then, the F# community has matured, established the <a href="http://fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation</a>,
but also built a number of mature end-to-end ecosystems that you can rely on such as <a href="http://fable.io">Fable</a>,
the F# to JavaScript compiler, and <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io">SAFE Stack</a> for full-stack web development.</p>
<p>For the upcoming December course in London, I added a number of demos and hands-on tasks built
using Fable, partly because running F# in a browser is an easy way to illustrate many concepts
and partly because Fable has some amazing functional-first libraries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="font-size:110%;margin:0px 5px 0px 0px"></i></em>
If you are interested in learning F# and attending our course, the next <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/courses/473-tomas-petricek-phil-trelford-fast-track-to-fsharp">F# FastTrack</a>
takes place on <strong>6-7 December</strong> in London at SkillsMatter. We also offer custom
on-site trainings. Get in touch at <a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">@tomaspetricek</a>
or email <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a> for a 10% discount for the course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the new samples I want to show, which I also <a href="https://vimeo.com/281241807">live coded at NDC 2018</a>,
is building a simple web-based Excel-like spreadsheet application. The spreadsheet demonstrates
all the great F# features such as domain modeling with types, the power of compositionality
and also how functional-first approach can be amazingly powerful for building user interfaces.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fslab-ionide/">Better F# data science with FsLab and Ionide</a></h1>
    <p>At <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/">NDC Oslo 2016</a>, I did a talk about some of the recent new F# projects
that are making data science with F# even nicer than it used to be. The talk covered a wider range
of topics, but one of the nice new thing I showed was the improved F# Interactive in the <a href="http://www.ionide.io/">Ionide
plugin for Atom</a> and the integration with FsLab libraries that it provides.</p>
<p>In particular, with the latest version of <a href="http://ionide.io">Ionide</a> for <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a>
and the latest version of <a href="http://www.fslab.org">FsLab package</a>, you can run code in F# Interactive
and you'll see resulting time series, data frames, matrices, vectors and charts as nicely pretty
printed HTML objects, right in the editor. The following shows some of the features (click on it
for a bigger version):</p>

</a>
<p>In this post, I'll write about how the new Ionide and FsLab integration works, how you can use
it with your own libraries and also about some of the future plans. You can also learn more by
getting the FsLab package, or watching the NDC talk..</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fsharp-events/">Upcoming F# events - learn Suave, FsLab &amp; more!</a></h1>
    <p>Some people in the F# community have reputation for traveling too much. I do not know how that is
possible, but as it happens, I will be visiting a couple of places in June and doing a number of
talks, workshops and courses. So, if you are thinking about getting into F#, web development with
F# using the <a href="http://suave.io">amazing Suave library</a>, playing with the new trendy F# to JavaScript
compiler <a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable">called Fable</a>, or learning about the recent
features in <a href="https://twitter.com/fslaborg/status/728397249697488896">FsLab and Ionide</a>, then
continue reading!</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fsharp-events/map.png" style="margin:0px 5% 20px 5%; width:90%" />
<p>The map includes all my travels, but not all of the pins are for F# events. I'm visiting Prague
just to see my family (even though there is a <a href="http://www.fsharping.cz">new awesome F# meetup there</a>)
and my stop in Paris is attending <a href="http://www.hapoc.org/hapop3">Symposium for the History and Philosophy of
Programming</a> (although we might still do something with the local F#
group too).</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/happy-new-year-tweets/">Happy New Year 2016 around the World: Behind the scenes of my #FsAdvent project</a></h1>
    <p>Just like <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/composing-christmas/">last year</a> and the
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/japan-advent-art/index.html">year</a>
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/japan-advent-art-en/">before</a>, I wanted to participate in the
<a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2015/10/25/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2015/">#FsAdvent</a>
event, where someone writes a blog post about something they did with F# during December.
Thanks to <a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/">Sergey Tihon</a> for the organization of the English
version and the <a href="http://connpass.com/event/22056/">Japanese F# community</a> for coming up with the
idea a few years ago!</p>
<p>As my blog post ended up on 31 December, I wanted to do something that would fit well with the
theme of ending of 2015 and starting of the new year 2016 and so I decided to write a little
interactive web site that tracks the "Happy New Year" tweets live across the globe. This is
partly inspired by <a href="http://twitter.github.io/interactive/newyear2014/">Happy New Year Tweets</a>
from Twitter in 2014, but rather than analyzing data in retrospect, you can watch 2016 come live!</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to make it to the Microsoft MVP summit this year. I didn't learn anything
secret (and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you!) but one thing I did learn is that there is a lot
of interest in data science and machine learning both inside Microsoft and in the MVP community.
What was less expected and more exciting was that there was also a lot of interest in F#, which
is a perfect fit for both of these topics!</p>
<p>When I visited Microsoft back in May to talk about <a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/Talks/2015/scalable-ml-ds-fsharp/redmond/">Scalable Machine Learning and Data Science
with F#</a> at an internal event,
I ended up chatting with the organizer about F# and we agreed that it would be nice to do more
on F#, which is how we ended up organizing the <a href="http://fsharpworks.com/mvp-summit/2015.html">F# + ML |&gt; MVP Summit 2015</a>
mini-conference on the Friday after the summit.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/fssnip-suave/">Creating web sites with Suave: How to contribute to F# Snippets</a></h1>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/fssnip-suave/logo.png" style="width:130px;float:right;margin-left:10px" />
<p>The core of many web sites and web APIs is very simple. Given an HTTP request,
produce a HTTP response. In F#, we can represent this as a function with type
<code>Request -&gt; Response</code>. To make our server scalable, we should make the function
<em>asynchronous</em> to avoid unnecessary blocking of threads. In F#, this can be
captured as <code>Request -&gt; Async&lt;Response&gt;</code>. Sounds pretty simple, right? So why
are there so many <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks/">evil frameworks</a>
that make simple web programming difficult?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a nice F# library called <a href="http://suave.io">Suave.io</a> that
is based exactly on the above idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suave is a simple web development F# library providing a lightweight web server
and a set of combinators to manipulate route flow and task composition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently decided to start a new version of the <a href="http://www.fssnip.net">F# Snippets</a>
web site and I wanted to keep the implementation functional, simple,
cross-platform and easy to contrbute to. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/FsSnip.Website/">first prototype of the
implementation</a> using Suave and
already received a few contributions via pull requests! In this blog post, I'll
share a few interesting aspects of the implementation and I'll give you some
good pointers where you can learn more about Suave. <em>There is no excuse for not
contributing to F# Snippets v2 after reading this blog post</em>!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/typed-revisited/">In the age of the web: Typed functional-first programming revisited</a></h1>
    <p>Most programming languages were designed before the age of web.
This matters because the web changes many assumptions that typed functional
language designers tak for granted. For example, programs do not run in a
<em>closed world</em>, but must instead interact with (changing and likely unreliable)
services and data sources, communication is often asynchronous or event-driven,
and programs need to interoperate with untyped environments like JavaScript
libraries.</p>
<p>How can statically-typed programming languages adapt to the modern world?
In this article, I look at one possible answer that is inspired by the F#
language and various F# libraries. In F#, we use <em>type providers</em> for
integration with external information sources and for integration with untyped
programming environments. We use <em>lightweight meta-programming</em> for targeting
JavaScript and <em>computation expressions</em> for writing asynchronous code.</p>
<p>This blog post is a shorter version of a <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/age-of-web/">ML workshop paper</a>
that I co-authored earlier this year and you should see this more as a position
statement. I'm not sure if F# and the solutions shown here are the best ones,
but I think they highlight very important questions in programming language
design that I very much see as unsolved.</p>
<p>The article has two sections. First, I'll go through a simple case study showing
how F# can be used to build a client-side web widget. Then, I'll discuss some
of the implications for programming language design based on the example.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/fslab-world-visualization/">Visualizing interesting world facts with FsLab</a></h1>
    <p>In case you missed my recent <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/announcing-fslab/">official FsLab announcement</a>,
FsLab is a data-science package for .NET built around F# that makes it easy to get data using <em>type providers</em>,
analyze them interactively (with great R integration) and visualize the results. You can find more on
on <a href="http://fslab.org">fslab.org</a>, which also has links to <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Understanding-the-World-with-F">some</a>
<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2015/The-F-Path-to-Data-Scripting-Nirvana">videos</a> and
<a href="http://fslab.org/download/">download page with templates</a> and other instructions.</p>
<p>Last time, I mentioned that we are working on integrating FsLab with the <a href="http://tahahachana.github.io/XPlot/">XPlot charting
library</a>. XPlot is a wonderful F# library built by
<a href="https://twitter.com/TahaHachana">Taha Hachana</a> that wraps two powerful HTML5 visualization libraries -
<a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Charts</a> and <a href="https://plot.ly/">plot.ly</a>.</p>
<p>I thought I'd see what interesting visualizations I can built with XPlot, so I opened the <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/WorldBank.html">World Bank type
provider</a> to get some data about the world
and Euro area, to make the blog post relevant to what is happening in the world today.</p>

    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/announcing-fslab/fslab.png" style="width:120px;float:right;margin:10px" />
<p>After over a year of working on FsLab and talking about it at conferences, it is finally time
for an official announcement. So, today, I'm excited to announce <a href="http://www.fslab.org">FsLab</a> -
a cross-platform package for doing data science with .NET and Mono.</p>
<p>It is probably not necessary to explain why data science is an important area. We live
surrounded by information, but extracting useful knowledge from the vast amounts of data is
not an easy task. You have to access data in different formats (JSON-based REST services, XML,
CSV files or even HTML tables), you need to deal with missing values, combine and align data
from multiple sources and then build visualizations (or reports) to tell the right story.</p>
<p>The goal of FsLab is to make this process easier. FsLab combines the power of F# type providers,
the efficiency and robustness of Mono and .NET and the high quality engineering of the
open-source ecosystem around F# and C#.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/restricting-ranges/">Comparing date range handling in C# and F#</a></h1>
    <p>I was recently working on some code for handling date ranges in
<a href="http://github.com/blueMountainCapital/Deedle">Deedle</a>. Although Deedle is written in F#,
I also wrote some internal integration code in C#. After doing that, I realized that the
code I wrote is actually reusable and should be a part of Deedle itself and so I went through
the process of rewriting a simple function from (fairly functional) C# to F#. This is a small
(and by no means representative!) example, but I think it nicely shows some of the reasons why
I like F#, so I thought I'd share it.</p>
<p>One thing that we are adding to Deedle is a "BigDeedle" implementation of internal data
structures. The idea is that you can load very big frames and series without actually loading
all data into memory.</p>
<p>When you perform slicing on a large series and then merge some of the parts of the series
(say, years 2010, 2012 and 2014), you end up with a series that combines a
couple of chunks. If you then restrict the series (say, from June 2012 to June 2014), you
need to restrict the ranges of the chunks:</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/restricting-ranges/drawing.png" alt="Demonstration" style="margin:15px; width:370px" />
<p>As the diagram shows, this is just a matter of iterating over the chunks, keeping those
in the range, dropping those outside of the range and restrictingthe boundaries of the other
chunks. So, let's start with the C# version I wrote.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/query-translation/">Writing custom F# LINQ query builder</a></h1>
    <p>One of the attendees of my <a href="http://www.fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html">virtual F# in Finance course</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/stuart_j_davies">Stuart</a> recently asked me a pretty advanced question about writing custom queries with F#, because he was
interested in writing a nicer querying library for Amazon DynamoDB (his <a href="https://github.com/stuartjdavies/FSharp.Cloud.AWS/blob/master/FSharp.Cloud.AWS/DynamoDB.fs">project is here</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>DynamoDB</code> could even be a type generated by a type provider (with all the tables available in Dynamo DB).
Now, the above example uses the built-in <code>query</code> builder, which is extensible, but, as far as I know, you have to
use LINQ expression trees to support it. In this article, I'm going to use an alternative approach with custom
builder (so you would write <code>dynamo { ... }</code> instead of <code>query { ... }</code>).</p>
<p>I wanted to write a minimal example showing how to do this, so this blog post is going to be mostly code
(unlike my other chatty articles!), but it should give you (and Stuart :-)) some idea how to do this.
I was quite intrigued by the idea of having a nice query language for DynamoDB, so I'm hoping that this
blog post can help move the project forward!</p>

<p>Since I <a href="https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek/status/544531884030840832">submitted my PhD thesis in December</a>,
I had a little bit of time to finish some of the things that I wanted to do for a really long time, but
never quite found time to actually do them. This included <a href="http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/mac-and-linux.html">getting the R provider to work on
Mac</a> and also creating a new
web site for my various functional programming trainings and books. I even have a nice domain name:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.functional-programming.net">www.functional-programming.net</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The page also discusses a couple of business reasons for looking into functional programming. So, if you're
a business person wondering why you should send your developers on an F# course, the site has the answers
for you too! (Or if you are developer and need a page for your boss.) The other place to check out is the
official <a href="http://www.fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation web page</a> is another great resource and the
<a href="http://fsharp.org/testimonials/">testimonials hosted there</a>.</p>
<p>The page has some information about the <a href="http://functional-programming.net/#trainings">various trainings we're offering at fsharpWorks</a>
and about the two F# books I co-authored (<a href="http://functional-programming.net/rwfp/">Real-World Functional Programming</a> and
brand new <a href="http://functional-programming.net/deepdives/">F# Deep Dives</a>).
I'm happy that we can offer some special deals on both the books and the F# FastTrack course in London,
so if you're considering getting into F#, now is a good time!</p>

    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks/diagram-narrow.png" style="float:right;margin:25px 0px 25px 20px" />
<p>This article is a follow up to my previous blog post about <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-layers">functional library
design</a>, but you do not need to read the previous one,
because I'll focus on a different topic.</p>
<p>In the previous article, I wrote about a couple of principles that I find useful when
designing libraries in a functional style. This follows from my experience with building
F# libraries, but the ideas are quite general and can be useful in any programming language.
Previously, I wrote how <em>multiple layers of abstraction</em> let you build libraries that make
80% of scenarios easy while still supporting the more interesting use cases.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll focus on two other points from the list - how to design <em>composable</em>
libraries and how (and why) to <em>avoid callbacks</em> in library design. As the title suggests, this
boils down to one thing - build <strong>libraries</strong> rather than <strong>frameworks</strong>!</p>

    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-layers/layers.png" style="float:right;margin:15px 0px 15px 10px" />
<p>Over the last few years, I created or contributed to a number of libraries including
<a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data">F# Data</a> for data access,
<a href="http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/">Deedle</a> for exploratory data science with C# and F#,
Markdown parser and code-formatter <a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/">F# Formatting</a>
and other fun libraries such as one for composing 3D objects <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/composing-christmas/">used in my Christmas blog
post</a>.</p>
<p>Building libraries is a fun and challenging task - even if we ignore all the additional things
that you need to get right such as testing, documentation and building (see <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/great-open-source/">my earlier blog
post</a>) and focus just on the API design.
In this blog post (or perhaps a series), I'll share some of the things I learned when trying
to answer the question: What should a good library look like?</p>
<p>I was recently watching Mark Seemann's course <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/01/22/a-functional-architecture-with-f/">A Functional architecture with F#</a>,
which is a great material on designing functional <em>applications</em>. But I also realised that not much
has been written on designing functional <em>libraries</em>. For some aspect, you can use functional patterns
like monads (see <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6120-functional-programming-design-patterns-with-scott-wlaschin">Scott Wlaschin's presentation</a>),
but this only answers a part of the question - it tells you how to design individual types, but
not an entire library...</p>

    <img src="http://fsprojects.github.io/FnuPlot/img/logo.png" style="width:120px;float:right;margin:10px" />
<p>There is a bunch of visualization and charting libraries for F#. Sadly, perhaps the most
advanced one, <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Charting/">F# Charting</a>, does not work
particularly well outside of Windows at the moment. There are also some work-in-progress
libraries based on HTML like <a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Foogle.Charts/">Foogle Charts</a> and
<a href="http://tahahachana.github.io/FsPlot/">FsPlot</a>, which are cross-platform, but not quite
ready yet.</p>
<p>Before Christmas, I got a <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FnuPlot/pull/2">notification from GitHub</a>
about a pull request for a simple gnuplot wrapper that I wrote a long time ago (and which used
to be carefully hidden <a href="http://fsxplat.codeplex.com">on CodePlex</a>).</p>
<p>The library is incomplete and I don't expect to dedicate too much time to maintaining it,
but it works quite nicely for basic charts and so I though I'd add the
<a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/ProjectScaffold/">ProjectScaffold</a> structure, do a few tweaks
and make it available as a modern F# project.</p>

<p>I guess that it might be a bit too late for adding to your list of new year's resulution now.
But just if you still have an empty slot (or in case an originally taken slot has become
available), your new year's resolution should be to get involved with F#!</p>
<p>Obviously, the goal of this blog post is to sell you some of my F# trainings and other materials -
including the online course on <a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html">F# in Finance</a> and our
<a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/fast-track.html">FastTrack to F#</a> course in London and New York
and also the <a href="http://manning.com/petricek2">F# Deep Dives</a> book. But to conceal this fact, I'm
going to fill most of the blog post with useful information about F#, the F# Software Foundation
and the F# community (but if you really just want to read about my courses, scroll down to the
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/why-fsharp-in-2015/index.html#courses">second section</a>).</p>

    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/composing-christmas/glowing.gif" style="float:right;margin:20px; width:200px" /> 
<p>This blog post is a part of the awesome <a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2014/">F# Advent Calendar</a>
(see the previous entry about <a href="http://richardminerich.com/2014/12/developing-an-algorithm-in-f-fast-rotational-alignments-with-gospers-hack/">writing algorithms in F#</a>
from Rick Minerich), so it inevitably needs a Christmassy theme. However, there is also
going to be a serious theme for the blog post, which is domain-specific languages.</p>
<p>One of my favorite examples of Domain-Specific Languages is a simple OpenGL library
that I wrote some time ago for composing 3D graphics in F#. You can see it in my
NDC 2014 talk <a href="http://vimeo.com/97315970">Domain Specific Languages, the functional way</a>
and I also used it for <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/puzzling-fsharp/index.html">Solving Puzzles with F#</a>
earlier on this blog.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the library is that it is very simple, but is rich enough to demonstrate
all the important concepts. In fact, the library is so easy to use that <a href="https://twitter.com/ptrelford/status/538098139430137856">even 8 years old can
do a talk about it</a>. So, if you're
spending Christmas with your family, perhaps you can go through this article with your children!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/deedle-v1/">New features and improvements in Deedle v1.0</a></h1>
    <p>As Howard Mansell already <a href="http://techblog.bluemountaincapital.com/2014/05/21/deedle-v1-0-release/">announced on the BlueMountain Tech blog</a>,
we have officially released the "1.0" version of Deedle. In case you have not
heard of Deedle yet, it is a .NET library for interactive data analysis and
exploration. Deedle works great with both C# and F#. It provides two main data
structures: <em>series</em> for working with data and time series and <em>frame</em> for working
with collections of series (think CSV files, data tables etc.)</p>
<p>The great thing about Deedle is that it has been becoming a foundational library
that makes it possible to integrate a wide range of diverse data-science components.
For example, the <a href="http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/">R type provider</a>
works well with Deedle and so does <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Charting/">F# Charting</a>.
We've been also working on integrating all of these into a single package called
<a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/FsLab">FsLab</a>, but more about that next time!</p>
<p>In this blog post, I'll have a quick look at a couple of new features in Deedle
(and corresponding R type provider release). Howard's announcement has a
<a href="http://techblog.bluemountaincapital.com/2014/05/21/deedle-v1-0-release/">more detailed list</a>,
but I just want to give a couple of examples and briefly comment on performance
improvements we did.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/update-monads/">Stateful computations in F# with update monads</a></h1>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/update-monads/code.png" style="float:right;margin:20px;width:200px" />
<p>Most discussions about monads, even in F#, start by looking at the well-known standard
monads for handling state from Haskell. The <em>reader</em> monad gives us a way to propagate
some read-only state, the <em>writer</em> monad makes it possible to (imperatively) produce
values such as logs and the <em>state</em> monad encapsulates state that can be read and changed.</p>
<p>These are no doubt useful in Haskell, but I never found them as important for F#.
The first reason is that F# supports state and mutation and often it is just easier
to use a mutable state. The second reason is that you have to implement three
different computation builders for them. This does not fit very well with the F# style
where you need to name the computation explicitly, e.g. by writing <code>async { ... }</code>
(See also my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/computation-zoo-padl">recent blog about the F# Computation Zoo paper</a>).</p>
<p>When visiting the Tallinn university in December (thanks to James Chapman, Juhan Ernits
&amp; Tarmo Uustalu for hosting me!), I discovered the work on <em>update monads</em> by Danel Ahman
and Tarmo Uustalu on <a href="http://cs.ioc.ee/~tarmo/papers/types13.pdf">update monads</a>, which elegantly unifies <em>reader</em>, <em>writer</em> and
<em>state</em> monads using a single abstraction.</p>
<p>In this article, I implement the idea of <em>update monads</em> in F#. Update monads are
parameterized by <em>acts</em> that capture the operations that can be done on the state.
This means that we can define just a single computation expression <code>update { ... }</code>
and use it for writing computations of all three aforementioned kinds.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/puzzling-fsharp/">Solving fun puzzles with F#</a></h1>
    <p>Do you need to convince your friends &amp; family that programming can be fun?
For the last Christmas, I got a puzzle as a gift. It is a number of small
cubes, joined together, that can be rotated and folded to form a bigger
(4x4x4) cube.</p>
<p>We spent the last few days of the year with family and a couple of friends
and I left the puzzle on the table. Every time I walked around, someone was
playing with it without much success. In the end, I said that if noone solves
it until 31 December, I'll write a program to do it. Which I did between 7 PM
and 8 PM and, voilà, here is what I got...</p>

<p>For the last few years, the Japanese F# community has been running the F# Advent Calendar
(<a href="http://atnd.org/events/10685">2010</a>, <a href="http://partake.in/events/1c24993a-c475-4fc2-bca4-7a1cd2f81869">2011</a>, <a href="http://atnd.org/events/33927">2012</a>).
Each advent day, one person writes an article about something interesting in F#. I have
been following the advent calendar last year on Twitter and when the planning started for
this year, I offered to write an article too. You might have noticed that I posted a
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/japan-advent-art/index.html">Japanse version of the article</a>
in December as part of the <a href="http://connpass.com/event/3935/">advent calendar 2013</a>.</p>
<p>A number of people helped to make this happen - <a href="http://twitter.com/igeta">@igeta</a> arranged everything and
helped with reviewing, <a href="http://twitter.com/yukitos">@yukitos</a> translated the article and
<a href="http://twitter.com/gab_km">@gab_km</a> reviewed the translation. Thanks!</p>
<p>But what should I write about? It would be nice to look at some of the F# open-source libraries
and projects that have been developing over the last year in the F# community. At the same time,
can I relate the topic of the article to Japan? After some thinking, I came up with the following
plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, we'll use the <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/">F# Data</a> library and the <a href="http://www.freebase.com">Freebase</a> to learn
something about Japanese art. I should add that thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/yukitos">@yukitos</a> the library now also has
a <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/jp">documentation in Japanese</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we'll pick one art work and try to recreate it in F#. Given my artistic skills, this
part will definitely fail, but we can try :-).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we'll use the <a href="http://funscript.info">FunScript project</a> to turn our F# code into
JavaScript, so that we can run it as a pure HTML web application that also works on mobile
phones and other devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>ここ数年、日本のF# コミュニティは「F# Advent Calendar」というイベントを開催しています
(<a href="http://atnd.org/events/10685">2010年</a>、
<a href="http://partake.in/events/1c24993a-c475-4fc2-bca4-7a1cd2f81869">2011年</a>、
<a href="http://atnd.org/events/33927">2012年</a>、
そして <a href="http://connpass.com/event/3935/">今年</a>)。
これはadvent dayごとに1人ずつ、F#に関連した何かしら興味深い記事を作成するというものです。
私は去年からTwitterでadvent calendarをチェックしていて、
今年からは私も参加しようと思い、記事を書きたいと申し出ました。
そうしたところ、数名の方からの協力を得ることができました。
<a href="https://twitter.com/igeta">@igeta</a> には参加手続きの諸々とレビューを、
<a href="http://twitter.com/yukitos">@ukitos</a> にはこの記事の翻訳を、そして
<a href="http://twitter.com/gab_km">@gab_km</a> には翻訳のレビューをしていただきました。
ありがとう！</p>
<p>けれども何についての記事を書くのがよいのでしょう？
過去一年にわたって、F#コミュニティで開発されているF#のオープンソースライブラリやプロジェクトを
いくつか紹介できるような記事がよさそうです。
それと同時に、日本に関連のあるトピックが何かないものでしょうか？
少し考えてみたところ、以下のようなプランを思いつきました：</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>まず、日本の絵画について学ぶために <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/">F# Data</a> ライブラリと <a href="http://www.freebase.com">Freebase</a> を組み合わせて使う。
このライブラリにはいまや <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/blob/master/docs/content/ja/index.md">日本語ドキュメント</a> があり、作成してくれた <a href="https://twitter.com/yukitos">@yukitos</a> に感謝しています。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>そして絵画作品を1つ選択して、F#でその作品を再生成する。
私の絵画スキルでは到底無理なのですが、試してみることはできます :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>最後に、 <a href="http://funscript.info">FunScriptプロジェクト</a> を使って
F#コードをJavaScriptに変換します。
そうすると純粋なHTML Webアプリケーションとして実行できるようになり、
携帯電話やその他のデバイスでも動作するようになります。</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/computation-zoo-padl/">The F# Computation Expression Zoo (PADL'14)</a></h1>
    <p>F# <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233182.aspx">computation expressions</a> are the
syntactic language mechanism that is used by features like sequence expressions and asynchronous
workflows. The aim of F# computation expressions is to provide a <em>single</em> syntactic mechanism
that provides convenient notation for writing a wide range of computations.</p>
<p>The syntactic mechanisms that are unified by computation expressions include Haskell <code>do</code>
notation and list comprehensions, C# iterators, asynchronous methods and LINQ queries,
Scala <code>for</code> comprehensions and Python generators to name just a few.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I started working on an academic article to explain what makes computation
expressions unique - and I think there is quite a few interesting aspects. Sadly, this is
often not very well explained and so the general perception is more like this...</p>

<p>The hard part about successful open-source development is not putting the first
version of your source code on GitHub. The hard part is what comes next. First
of all, there are <em>community aspects</em> - making sure that the project fits well with
other work in the area, engaging the community and contributors, planing future
directions for the project and so on. Secondly, there is an <em>infrastructural side</em> -
making sure that there is a package (on <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=fsharp">NuGet in the F# world</a>),
easy to run and useful tests and also up-to-date documentation and tutorials.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to talk about the <em>infrastructural side</em>, which is
easier of the two, but nevertheless, difficult to get right!
Fortunately, the F# community made an amazing progress in this direction, so let's
have a look at some of the tools that make this possible...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/tuples-in-csharp/">How many tuple types are there in C#?</a></h1>
    <p>In a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18718232/when-should-i-write-my-functions-in-curried-form/18721711">recent StackOverflow question</a>
the poster asked about the difference between <em>tupled</em> and <em>curried</em> form of a function in F#.
In F#, you can use pattern matching to easily define a function that takes a tuple as an argument.
For example, the poster's function was a simple calculation that multiplies the number
of units sold <em>n</em> by the price <em>p</em>:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs1', 1)" class="f">salesTuple</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 2)" class="i">price</span>, <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 3)" class="i">count</span>) <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 4)" class="i">price</span> <span class="o">*</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs4', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs4', 5)" class="f">float</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 6)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 6)" class="i">count</span>)
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The function takes a single argument of type <code>Tuple&lt;float, int&gt;</code> (or, using the nicer F# notation
<code>float * int</code>) and immediately decomposes it into two variables, <code>price</code> and <code>count</code>. The other
alternative is to write a function in the <em>curried</em> form:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs5', 7)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs5', 7)" class="f">salesCurried</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 8)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 8)" class="i">price</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 9)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 9)" class="i">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 10)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 10)" class="i">price</span> <span class="o">*</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs4', 11)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs4', 11)" class="f">float</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 12)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 12)" class="i">count</span>)
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Here, we get a function of type <code>float -&gt; int -&gt; float</code>. Usually, you can read this just as a
function that takes <code>float</code> and <code>int</code> and returns <code>float</code>. However, you can also use <em>partial
function application</em> and call the function with just a single argument - if the price of
an apple is $1.20, we can write <code>salesCurried 1.20</code> to get a <em>new</em> function that takes just
<code>int</code> and gives us the price of specified number of apples. The poster's question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when I want to implement a function that would have taken <em>n &gt; 1</em> arguments,
should I for example always use a curried function in F# (...)? Or should I take
the simple route and use regular function with an n-tuple and curry later on
if necessary?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18718232/when-should-i-write-my-functions-in-curried-form/18721711#18721711">my answer on StackOverflow</a>.
The point of this short introduction was that the question inspired me to think about how
the world looks from the C# perspective...</p>

<p>Exactly two weeks ago, I started a three month internship at BlueMountain Capital in New York.
They have a <a href="http://techblog.bluemountaincapital.com/">technical blog</a> and should be well known to the
F# community thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/BlueMountainCapital/FSharpRProvider">R type provider</a>
which was written by Howard Mansell (<a href="https://twitter.com/hmansell">@hmansell</a>).
I'll have the pleasure of working with Howard on some more open source data-science related tools for F#
(and C#). I'll write more about these when we have something to share, but if you want to
contribute and help us, join the Data and Machine Learning <a href="http://fsharp.org/technical-groups/">working group at F# Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from my work, I'm also happy to get involved with the great F# community in New York!
We already have some events planned - <strong>Progressive F# Tutorials</strong> and <strong>FastTrack to F#</strong> are
scheduled for September 16.-19. so you can become an F# guru in 4 days :-). But I'm also happy
to have a chat with anyone interested in F# and perhaps do a lunch time talk, if you need to
convince your colleagues or boss that F# is a good choice.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/deep-dives-update/">Update on the F# Deep Dives book</a></h1>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/manning-deep-dives/cover.jpg" class="rdecor" title="F# Deep Dives" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:15px"/>
<p>It has been some time since I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/manning-deep-dives.aspx/">last wrote about F# Deep Dives</a>
- a new project that I'm working on together with <a href="http://www.manning.com">Manning</a>,
<a href="http://trelford.com/blog">Phil Trelford</a> and a number of F# experts, so I'd like to write a quick
update. In summary, working on a book with more than 10 co-authors is more difficult than one
would think (and 10 people cannot write a book in 1/10 of the time :-)), but now that the holidays
are almost over, you can expect more frequent updates again!</p>
<p>First of all, I shoud mention that you can buy <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek2/">the Early Access preview</a>
of the book from Manning and there is already one <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2013/01/05/Review+In+Advance+F+Deep+Dives.aspx">in advance review of the book</a>
from Ted Neward (thanks!) who says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of this writing, the early-access [...] version had only Chapters 3 and Chapter 11,
but the other topics [...] are juicy and meaty. [T]he prose from the MEAP edition is
pretty easy to read already, despite the fact that it's early-access material. In particular,
the Markdown parser they implement in chapter 3 is a great example of a non-trivial
language parser, which is not an easy task (...).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned, the book is unique in that it is not written just by me and Phil - each chapter
is written by a real-world F# expert and many of them use F# in production. The disadvantage is
that they are all busy people, but we have close to half of the planned chapters available already...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/types-and-math.aspx/">Power of mathematics: Reasoning about functional types</a></h1>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/types-and-maths/distributivity.png" class="rdecor" />
<p>One of the most amazing aspects of mathematics is that it applies to such a wide range
of areas. The same mathematical rules can be applied to completely different objects
(say, forces in physics or markets in economics) and they work exactly the same way.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll look at one such fascinating use of mathematics - we'll use
elementary school algebra to reason about functional data types.</p>
<p>In functional programming, the best way to start solving a problem is to think about
the data types that are needed to represent the data that you will be working with.
This gives you a simple starting point and a great tool to communicate and
develop your ideas. I call this approach <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx">Type-First Development and I wrote about
it earlier</a>, so I won't repeat
that here.</p>
<p>The two most elementary types in functional languages are <em>tuples</em> (also called pairs
or product types) and <em>discriminated unions</em> (also called algebraic data types, case
classes or sum types). It turns out that these two types are closely related to
<em>multiplication</em> and <em>addition</em> in algebra...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async-gotchas.aspx/">Async in C# and F#: Asynchronous gotchas in C#</a></h1>
    <p>Back in February, I attended the annual MVP summit - an <a href="http://www.2013mvpsummit.com/about">event organized by Microsoft
for MVPs</a>. I used that opportunity to also visit
Boston and New York and do two F# talks and to record a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Tomas-Petricek-How-F-Learned-to-Stop-Worrying-and-Love-the-Data" title="Tomas Petricek (Channel 9): How F# Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Data">Channel9 lecutre about type
providers</a>.
Despite all the <em>other activities</em> (often involving pubs, other F# people and long
sleeping in the mornings), I also managed to come to some talks!</p>

<p>One (non-NDA) talk was the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2013/02/20/mvp-summit-presentation-on-async.aspx" title="Lucian Wischik, Stephen Toub: Async Clinic">Async Clinic</a> talk about the new <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords
in C# 5.0. Lucian and Stephen talked about common problems that C# developers face when
writing asynchronous programs. In this blog post, I'll look at some of the problems from
the F# perspective. The talk was quite lively, and someone recorded the reaction of the
F# part of the audience as follows...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-data.aspx/">F# Data: New type provider library</a></h1>
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/master/misc/logo.png" class="rdecor" style="width:120px;height:120px;" />
<p>When F# 3.0 type providers were still in beta version, I wrote a couple of type
providers as examples for talks. These included the WorldBank type provider
(now available <a href="http://www.tryfsharp.org">on Try F#</a>) and also type provider for
XML that infered the structure from sample.<br />
For some time, these were hosted as part of <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpx/">FSharpX</a>
and the authors of FSharpX also added a number of great features.</p>
<p>When I found some more time earlier this year, I decided to start a new library
that would be fully focused on data access in F# and on type providers and
I started working on <strong>F# Data</strong>. The library has now reached a stable state
and <a href="http://www.navision-blog.de/blog/2013/03/27/fsharpx-1-8-removes-support-for-document-type-provider/">Steffen also announced</a>
that the document type providers (JSON, XML and CSV) are not going to be available
in FSharpX since the next version.</p>
<p>This means that if you're interested in accessing data using F# type providers,
you should now go to F# Data. Here are the most important links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data">F# Data source code on GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fsharp.github.com/FSharp.Data/">F# Data documentation &amp; tutorials</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Data">F# Data on NuGet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Before looking at the details, I would like to thank to <a href="https://github.com/ovatsus">Gustavo Guerra</a>
who made some amazing contributions to the library! (More contributors are always welcome,
so continue reading if you're interested...)</p>

<p>After a few years, I finally managed to find the time to attend the 
  <a href="http://www.2013mvpsummit.com/">MVP Summit</a> this year. The Summit is
  an annual event where people who are active in Microsoft technical communities come
  to the Microsoft headquarters to learn about new things (and, of course, tell them 
  how they should be doing their job :-)). The Summit is a great place to meet interesting
  people (so if you're reading this and will be there, definitely get in touch!)
</p>

<p>The good news - for those interested in F# - is that I'll be doing two F# talks 
  on the way. I'll stop in <strong>Boston</strong> on <strong>February 13</strong> and then in <strong>New York</strong> on <strong>February 25</strong>.
  I'll be talking about different topics (Google tells me that the distance is 
  <em>only</em> 216 miles!)

<p>For some time now, I've been writing my F# blog posts (and other F# articles
published elsewhere) by combining F# code snippets and Markdown formatting. In fact,
I even wrote a Markdown parser in F# so that I can post-process documents (to
generate references etc). You can read about the Markdown parser in an upcoming
<a href="http://manning.com/petricek2/">F# Deep Dives</a> book - currently, it is available
as a free chapter!</p>
<p>During the Christmas break, I finally found enough time to clean-up the code I
was using and package it properly into a documented library that is easy to install and use.
Here are the most important links:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/tree-zipper-query.aspx/">Processing trees with F# zipper computation</a></h1>
    <p>One of the less frequently advertised new features in F# 3.0 is the <em>query syntax</em>.
It is an extension that makes it possible to add custom operations in an F#
computation expression. The standard <code>query { .. }</code> computation uses this to define
operations such as sorting (<code>sortBy</code> and <code>sortByDescending</code>) or operations for taking
and skipping elements (<code>take</code>, <code>takeWhile</code>, ...). For example, you can write:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
<span class="l">2: </span>
<span class="l">3: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs1', 1)" class="k">query</span> <span class="pn">{</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 2)" class="id">x</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">1</span> <span class="o">..</span> <span class="n">10</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 3)" class="k">take</span> <span class="n">3</span>
        <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs4', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs4', 4)" class="k">sortByDescending</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 5)" class="id">x</span> <span class="pn">}</span>
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In this article I'll use the same notation for processing trees using the <em>zipper</em>
pattern. I'll show how to define a computation that allows you to traverse a tree
and perform transformations on (parts) of the tree. For example, we'll be able to
say "Go to the left sub-tree, multiply all values by 2. Then go back and to the
right sub-tree and divide all values by 2" as follows:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
<span class="l">2: </span>
<span class="l">3: </span>
<span class="l">4: </span>
<span class="l">5: </span>
<span class="l">6: </span>
<span class="l">7: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs45', 172)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs45', 172)" class="k">tree</span> <span class="pn">{</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 173)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 173)" class="id">x</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="id">sample</span> <span class="k">do</span>
       <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs49', 174)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs49', 174)" class="k">left</span> 
       <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs50', 175)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs50', 175)" class="k">map</span> <span class="pn">(</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 176)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 176)" class="id">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="pn">)</span> 
       <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs51', 177)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs51', 177)" class="k">up</span>
       <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs52', 178)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs52', 178)" class="k">right</span>
       <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs50', 179)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs50', 179)" class="k">map</span> <span class="pn">(</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 180)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 180)" class="id">x</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="pn">)</span> 
       <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs53', 181)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs53', 181)" class="k">top</span> <span class="pn">}</span>
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This example behaves quite differently to the usual <code>query</code> computation. It mostly
relies on custom operations like <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>up</code> that allow us to navigate
through a tree (descend along the left or right sub-tree, go back to the parent node).
The only operation that <em>does something</em> is the <code>map</code> operation which transforms the
current sub-tree.</p>

at how this works...</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/manning-deep-dives/cover.jpg" class="rdecor" title="F# Deep Dives" style="margin-bottom:15px"/>

<p>
  The F# language has been around for longer than many people suspect. My <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsquotations.aspx">first, completely outdated,
  blog post</a> was from May 2006. The Microsoft Research releases, sometime around 2006 were the
  first stable versions that gained some interest and slowly attracted commercial users.
</p>

<p>A lot has changed since the early days. F# now includes powerful features like <em>computation expressions</em>
  and <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and F# 3.0 comes with unique <em>type provider</em> mechanism.
</p>

<p>There is an increasing number of users from diverse domains: F# is used to model complex domains
  in <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/dl/techmesh-london-2012/slides/TobiasGedell_EdenAnFWPFFrameworkForBuildingGUITools.pdf">finance</a> and science; asynchronous and concurrent features are used to write server-side components
  of <a href="http://theburningmonk.com/">social games</a> and <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trelford-functional">trading systems</a>,
  but also in <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/dl/techmesh-london-2012/slides/AdamGranicz_DevelopingAndIntegratingWebSharperApplicationsWithFacebook.pdf">web programming</a>;
  the expressivity of F# is used by machine learning experts to
  handle dirty data or <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=293">classify XBox players</a>. Moreover, the <a href="http://fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation</a>
  has been recently founded to support the collaboration between different commercial users, open-source 
  community and academia.
</p>

<p>There is an increasing interest in F#, but many of those who approach it ask (excellent) questions such as:
  <em>"In what problem domains can I benefit from F#?"</em> or <em>"How do I use F# in finance/science/gaming or web programming?"</em>
  and most importantly <em>"How do I approach different problems in F#?"</em>
</p>

  In only two weeks, you can come to two-day <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progfsharp-2012">Progressive F# Tutorials</a>
  packed with tutorials for both F# beginners and experts. At the beginning of December,
  the <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/">TechMesh Conference</a> comes with three days of
  talks about alternative (and future) technologies.
</p>

<p>I'll be speaking at both Progressive F# Tutorials and TechMesh and I'm also doing a tutorial
  at TechMesh, so if you want to learn about F#, type providers in F# 3.0 and financial computing
  with F#, here are some talks that you should not miss...

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/applicative-functors.aspx/">Applicative functors: definition and syntax</a></h1>
    
<p>In a recent blog post, <a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/08/applicative-functors/" title="Edward Z. Yang: Applicative functors">Edward Z. Yang talks about applicative functors</a>. 
He mentions two equivalent definitions of applicative functors - the standard
definition used in Haskell libraries (<code>Applicative</code>) and an alternative that
has been also presented in the <a href="http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html" title="C. McBride and R. Paterson: Applicative Programming with Effects">original paper</a>, but is generally less
familiar (<code>Monoidal</code>).</p>

<p>The standard definition makes a perfect sense with the standard uses in Haskell,
however I always preferred the alternative definition. Edward uses the alternative
(<code>Monoidal</code>) definition to explain the laws that should hold about applicative 
functors and to explain <em>commutative</em> applicative functors, but I think it
is even more useful.</p>

<p>The <code>Monoidal</code> definition fits nicely with a trick that you can use to 
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx" title="T. Petricek: Beyond the Monad fashion (I.): Writing idioms in LINQ">encode applicative functors in C# using LINQ</a> and I also used it as 
a basis for an F# syntax extension that allows writing code using applicative 
functors in a similar style as using monads (which is discussed in my draft 
paper about <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tp322/papers/notations.html" title="T. Petricek and D. Syme: Syntax Matters: Writing abstract computations in F#">writing abstract computations in F#</a>). And I also think that
<em>commutative</em> applicative functors deserve more attention.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx/">Why type-first development matters</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/type-first-development/tfd.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>Using functional programming language changes the way you write code in a number
of ways. Many of the changes are at a <em>small-scale</em>. For example, you learn how to express
computations in a shorter, more declarative way using higher-order functions.
However, there are also many changes at a <em>large-scale</em>. The most notable one
is that, when designing a program, you start thinking about the (data) types
that represent the data your code works with.</p>

<p>In this article, I describe this approach. Since the acronym TDD is already taken,
I call the approach Type-First Development (TFD), which is probably a better name anyway.
The development is not <em>driven</em> by types. It <em>starts</em> with types, but the rest of the
implementation can still use test-driven development for the implementation.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates the approach using a case study from a real life:
My example is a project that I started working on with a friend who needed a
system to log journeys with a company car (for expense reports). Using the
type-first approach made it easier to understand and discuss the problem.</p>

<p>In many ways, TFD is a very simple approach, so this article just gives a name
to a practice that is quite common among functional and F# programmers (and
we have been <a href="http://functional-programming.net/courses/">teaching it at our F# trainings</a> for the last year)...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/agent-event-reporting.aspx/">Reporting events from F# Agents</a></h1>
    
<p>Over the last year, I wrote quite a lot of articles about agent-based programming in F#.
Agents (inspired by Erlang) provide a great abstraction for writing concurrent and scalable
systems. They are a great fit for both server-side development (for example, handling 
a large number of concurrent requests), but also for user interface (for example, keeping
state in an application with background tasks and interactive interface).</p>

<p>When writing reusable agents, we usually encapsulate agent in an F# object type. The 
type provides methods for sending messages to the agent. However, sometimes the agent
also needs to report some state change that can be handled by another interested agent.
This is done using F# events. However, F# events do not specify threading behaviour, 
so there is a number of options.</p>

<p>In this article (inspired by a recent email discussion), I describe three ways of 
reporting events from an agent. The options differ in what thread is used to report the
event. Choosing the right option is important as it affects scalability and simplicity
of your agent-based code.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-academia.aspx/">F# in Academia: Present at upcoming events!</a></h1>
    
<p>The F# language was born as a combination of the pragmatic and real-world .NET 
platform and functional programming, which had a long tradition in academia. 
Many useful ideas or libraries in F# (like <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and 
<em>first-class events</em>) are inspored by research in functional programming
(namely, the work on <em>monads</em>, <em>continuations</em> and <em>functional reactive programming</em>).</p>

<p>Exchanging the ideas between the research community and the real-world is one
of the areas where F# excels. Indeed, the first applicatiosn of F# inside Microsoft
(in the Machine Learning group at Cambridge) were all about this - combining
research in machine learning with a language that can be easily used in practice.</p>

<p>However, F# and the F# users also made numerous contributions to the programming
language research community. Influential ideas that come from F# include 
<em>active patterns</em> and the F# style of <em>meta-programming</em> for translating F# to 
JavaScript). I think there is a lot more that the academic community can learn
from the F# community, so I'd like to invite you to talk about your ideas 
at two upcoming academic events!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-implement.aspx/">TryJoinads (VII.) - Implementing joinads for async workflows</a></h1>
    
<p>The article <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-prog.aspx">Asynchronous workflows and joinads</a> gives numerous
examples of programming with asynchronous workflows using the <code>match!</code> construct.
Briefly, when matching on multiple asynchronous workflows, they are executed in 
parallel. When pattern matching consists of multiple clauses, the clause that matches
on computations that complete first gets executed. These two behaviours are 
implemented by the <code>Merge</code> and the <code>Choose</code> operation of joinads. Additionally, 
asynchronous workflows require the <code>Alias</code> operation, which makes it possible to 
share the result of a started asynchronous workflow in multiple clauses.</p>

<p>In this article, we look at the definition of the additional <code>AsyncBuilder</code>
operations that enable the <code>match!</code> syntax. We do not look at additional examples
of using the syntax, because these can be <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-prog.aspx">found in a previous article</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This blog post is a re-publication of a tutorial from the <a href="http://tryjoinads.org">TryJoinads.org</a>
web page. If you read the article there, you can run the examples interactively
and experiment with them: <a href="http://tryjoinads.org/index.html?implement/async.html">view the article on TryJoinads</a>.</em></p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-parsing.aspx/">TryJoinads (VI.) - Parsing with joinads</a></h1>
    
<p>In functional programming, parser combinators are a powerful way of writing parsers. 
A parser is a function that, given some input, returns possible parsed values and 
the rest of the input. Parsers can be written using combinators for composition, for
example run two parsers in sequence or perform one parser any number of times.</p>

<p>Parsers can also implement the monad structure. In some cases, this makes the parser
less efficient, but it is an elegant way of composing parsers and we can also benefit
from the syntactic support for monads. In this article, we implement a simple parser
combinators for F# and we look what additional expressive power we can get from the
<em>joinad</em> structure and <code>match!</code> construct. This article is largely based on a
previous article <em>"Fun with Parallel Monad Comprehensions"</em>, which can be found on the
<a href="../pubs.html">publications</a> page.</p>

<p>Last week, I gave a talk on asynchronous programming in F# at <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012">London QCon 2012</a>.
The talk was a part of <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=560">The Rise of Scala &amp; Functional Programming</a> 
track organized by Charles Humble. Reactive and asynchronous programming was a topic that was repeated
a couple of times during the whole session - Sadek Drobi talked about <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentation/Non%20blocking,%20composable%20reactive%20web%20programming%20with%20Iteratees%20in%20Play2">non-blocking reactive web framework
Play2</a>
and Damien Katz talked about <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentation/Erlang%20in%20the%20real%20world:%20CouchDB">Erlang and CouchDB</a>.</p>

<p>I used the one hour slot to implement "Rectangle Drawing App" - a simple application that 
shows how to write complete client-server application just using F#. On the
server-side, I used asynchronous workflows to write HTTP server with an F#
agent. On the client-side, I used asynchronous workflows to express user
interface logic and the <a href="http://pitfw.org/">Pit project</a> to run F# code as
JavaScript that works everywhere. The app definitely had a huge commercial potential:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-options.aspx/">TryJoinads (V.) - Implementing the option joinad</a></h1>
    
<p>This article shows how to implement the <em>joinad</em> structure for one of the 
simplest monads - the <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code> type. This is a slightly oversimplified example. 
The <code>match!</code> construct can be used to write patterns that specify that a monadic
value (in this case <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code>) should contain a certain value, or we can specify
that we do not require a value. When working with options, this means the same thing 
as matching the value against <code>Some</code> and against <code>_</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>However, the example demonstrates the operations that need to be implemented and
their type signatures. Later articles give more interesting examples including
parsers and asynchronous workflows (and you can explore other examples if you look
at the <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Joinads">FSharp.Joiands source code</a> at GitHub).</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-join-calculus.aspx/">TryJoinads (IV.) - Concurrency using join calculus</a></h1>
    
<p>Join calculus provides a declarative way of expressing asynchronous synchronization
patterns. It has been use as a basis for programming languages (JoCaml and COmega), but also
as a basis for libraries (embedded in C# and Scala). Using joinads, it is possible to 
embed join calculus in F# with a nice syntax using the <code>match!</code> construct. Formally,
join calculus does not form a <em>monad</em>, but it can be viewed as a version of <em>joinad</em>
as described in the <a href="../pubs.html">first paper on joinads</a>.</p>

<p>The programming model is based on <em>channels</em> and <em>join patterns</em>. A channel can be viewed
as a thread-safe mailbox into which we can put values without blocking the caller. In some
sense, this is quite similar to <a href="agents.html">F# agents</a>. A join pattern is then a rule
saying that a certain combination of values in channels should trigger a specific reaction
(and remove values from the channels). The ability to match on multiple channels distinguishes
join calculus from F# agents.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-agents.aspx/">TryJoinads (III.): Agent-based programming</a></h1>
    
<p>Another area where the <code>match!</code> syntax can be used is when programming with F# <em>agents</em>,
implemented by the <code>MailboxProcessor</code> type. Formally, agents do not form the monad
structure in a useful way - when programming with agents, we do not compose a new agents,
but instead we write code that (imperatively) receives messages from the agent's mailbox
and handles them.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates an <code>agent { ... }</code> computation builder that can be used for 
implementing the body of an agent. Normally, the body of an agent is an <em>asynchronous
workflow</em>. The code in the body uses <code>let!</code> to perform asynchronous operations, most 
importantly to call <code>inbox.Receive</code> to get the next message from the inbox. When the
agent intends to handle only certain kinds of messages, it can use <code>inbox.Scan</code>. When
using the <code>agent</code> builder, pattern matching on messages can be written using <code>match!</code> and
it is possible to write code that ignores certain types of messages simply by writing an
incomplete pattern matching.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinad-tasks.aspx/">TryJoinads (II.): Task-based parallelism</a></h1>
    
<p>The implementation of joinad operations for the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type is quite similar to the 
implementation of <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code>, because the two types have similar properties. They both
produce at most one value (or an exception) and they both take some time to complete.</p>

<p>Just like for asynchronous workflows, pattern matching on multiple computations using 
<code>match!</code> gives us a parallel composition (with the two tasks running in parallel) and
choice between clauses is non-deterministic, depending on which clause completes first.</p>

<p>Unlike asynchronous workflows, the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type does not require any support for
aliasing. A value of type <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> represents a <em>running</em> computation that can be
accessed from multiple parts of program. In this sense, the type <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code> is more
similar to a function <code>unit -&gt; Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> than to the type <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> itself.</p>

<p>The key difference between tasks and asynchronous workflows is that the latter provides
better support for writing non-blocking computations that involve <em>asynchronous</em> 
long-running operations such as I/O or waiting for a certain event. Tasks are more
suitable for high-performance CPU-intensive computations.</p>

<p>If you have been following my blog, you've probably already heard of <em>joinads</em>. It is
a research extension of F# computation expressions (or monads in Haskell). The extension
makes computation expressions more useful in domains like parallel, concurrent and reactive
programming. However, it can be used for any type of computation including, for example, parsers.
If you're interested in detailed description, you can find it in two academic papers that
I blogged about previously: <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">PADL 2011</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/docase-haskell.aspx">Haskell 2011</a>.</p>

<p>The extension adds a keyword <code>match!</code> - as the syntax suggests, it is akin to pattern
matching using <code>match</code>, but instead of pattern matching on values, you can pattern match
on computations like <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code> (or on other monadic values). Just like other features of
computation expressions, the <code>match!</code> syntax is translated to applications of several
methods defined by the computation builder.</p>

<p>I won't say more about joinads in this post, because you can now easily try joinads yourself...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-generic-numeric.aspx/">F# Math (IV.) - Writing generic numeric code</a></h1>
    
<p>Generic numeric code is some calculation that can be used for working with multiple different numeric 
  types including types such as <code>int</code>, <code>decimal</code> and <code>float</code> or even our own 
  numeric types (such as the type for <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx">clock arithmetic 
  from the previous article of the series</a>). Generic numeric code differs from ordinary generic F# code such 
  as the <code>'a list</code> type or <code>List.map</code> function, because <em>numeric code</em> uses numeric operators 
  such as <code>+</code> or <code>&gt;=</code> that are defined differently for each numeric type.</p>

<p>When writing simple generic code that has some type parameter <code>'T</code>, we don’t know anything about 
  the type parameter and there is no way to restrict it to a numeric type that provides all the operators that 
  we may need to use in our code. This is a limitation of the .NET runtime and F# provides two ways for 
  overcoming it.</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Static member constraints</strong> can be used to write generic code where the actual 
    numeric operations are resolved at compile-time (and a generic function is specialized for all required
    numeric types). This approach makes resulting code very efficient and is generally very easy to use
    when writing a function such as <code>List.sum</code>.</li>

  <li><strong>Global numeric associations</strong> (available in F# PowerPack) give us a way to obtain 
    an interface implementing required numeric operations dynamically at runtime. This approach has some 
    runtime overhead, but can be used for complex numeric types (such as <code>Matrix&lt;'T&gt;</code>).</li>

  <li><strong>Combination of both</strong> techniques can be used to implement complex numeric type
    that is generic over the contained numeric values and has only a minimal runtime overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Static member constraints are a unique feature of F# that is not available in other .NET
  languages, so if you're interested in writing numeric code for .NET,
  this may be a good reason for choosing F#. In C# or Visual Basic, you would be limited to the 
  second option (which can be implemented in C#). In dynamic languages (like IronPython), everything
  is dynamic, so numeric computations can work with any numeric type, but will be significantly
  less efficient. In the rest of the article, we look at the three options summarized above.

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx/">F# Math (III.) - Defining custom numeric types</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article, we define an F# numeric type for calculating in the modular arithmetic (also called clock arithmetic)
  [<a href="#ppcnuml">1</a>].  
  Modular arithmetic is used for calculations where we want to keep a value within a specified range by counting in cycles. 
  For example, a maximal value on clock is 12 hours. When we add 11 hours and 3 hours, the value overflows and the result is 
  2 hours. Aside from clocks, this numeric system is also essential in cryptography or, for example, in music.</p>

<p>This tutorial shows several techniques that are essential when defining any new numeric type in F#. Most importantly, you’ll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a numeric type with overloaded operators </li>
<li>Define a numeric literal for constructing numbers of our new type</li>
<li>Enable calculating with our type in F# lists and matrices</li>
<li>Hide implementation details of a numeric type</li>
</ul>

<p>We define type <code>IntegerZ5</code> that implements modular arithmetic with modulus 5, meaning that valid values are in the range 
  from 0 to 4 and we equip the type with operations such as addition and multiplication. When an operation produces a value that would 
  be outside of the range, we adjust it by adding or subtracting the modulus (in our case 5). Here are some examples of calculations 
  that we’ll be able to write:</p>
<pre>
2 + 1 = 3 (mod 5)
4 * 2 = 3 (mod 5)
List.sum [ 0; 1; 2; 3 ] = 1 (mod 5)
</pre>

<p>In the first case, we can perform the operation without any adjustments. In the second case, we multiply 4 by 2 and get 8 as the 
  result, which is out of the required range. To correct it, we calculate the remainder after a division by 5 (written as <code>8 % 5</code> in F#), 
  which gives us 3. Finally, the last example shows that we’d also like to be able to use our type with lists. If we add values 0, 1, 2
  and 3, we get 6 which is adjusted to 1.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-matrix.aspx/">F# Math (II.) - Using matrices for graph algorithms</a></h1>
    
<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-numeric.aspx">previous article of this 
  series</a>, we looked at <code>complex</code> and <code>BigRational</code>, which are two 
  numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. Aside from these two, the PowerPack 
  library also contains a type <code>matrix</code> representing a two-dimensional matrix
  of floating-point values.</p>

<p>In this article, you'll learn how to work with matrices in F#, using some 
  of the functions provided by F# PowerPack. I'll demonstrate the library using an 
  example that represents <em>graphs</em> using a, so called, <em>adjacency matrix</em>.
  If you're not familiar with this concept, you don't need to worry. It is quite simple
  and it will be clear once we look at an example.
  The matrix represents which vertices of a graph are connected with other vertices by 
  an edge. Many of the standard operations on matrices are useful when working with 
  adjacency matrix, so this tutorial will cover the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating matrices from lists and using functions from the <code>Matrix</code> module</li>
  <li>Using slices to read or modify a part of matrix</li>
  <li>Performing standard operations with matrices such as transposition and matrix multiplication</li>
  <li>Using higher order functions for working with matrices</li>
</ul>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-numeric.aspx/">F# Math (I.) - Numeric types in PowerPack</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article, we'll briefly look at two numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. 
  The type <code>complex</code> represents complex numbers consisting of real and imaginary parts. 
  Both parts are stored as a floating point numbers. The type <code>BigRational</code> represents 
  rational numbers consisting of numerator and denominator of arbitrary sizes. Integers of arbitrary
  size are represented using <code>BigInteger</code> type that is available in .NET 4.0 
  (in the <code>System.Numerics.dll</code> assembly). On .NET 2.0, the <code>BigInteger</code>
  type is also a part of F# PowerPack.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/powerpack-series/z5snip.png" style="float:right;margin:0px 0px 5px 15px" />
<p>This article is the first article of a series where I'll explain some of the
  F# features that are useful for numeric computing as well as some functionality from 
  the F# PowerPack library. Most of the content was originally written for 
  the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273075.aspx">Numerical Computing in F#</a> chapter on MSDN (that I 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/real-world-book-msdn.aspx">announced earlier</a>), 
  but then we decided to focus on using F# with third party libraries that provide more
  efficient implementation and richer set of standard numeric functionality that's 
  needed when implementing machine learning and probabilistic algorithms or performing 
  statistical analysis. If you're interested in these topics, then the last section 
  (below) gives links to the important MSDN articles.</p>

<p>However, F# PowerPack still contains some useful functionality. It includes two
  additional numeric types and an implementation of matrix that integrates nicely
  with F#. The series also demonstrates how to use features of the F# language 
  (and core libraries) to write numeric code elegantly. In particular, we'll use the
  following aspects:</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Overloaded operators.</strong> Any type can provide overloaded version of standard numeric 
    operators such as +, -, * and / as well as other non-standard operators (such as .*). 
    As a result, libraries can implement their own numeric types which are 
    indistinguishable from built-in types such as int.</li>

  <li><strong>Numeric literals.</strong> F# math libraries can enable using new numeric literals in the code. For example, you can 
    write a <code>BigRational</code> value representing one third as <code>1N/3N</code>. The <code>N</code> suffix used in the 
    notation is not hardcoded in the F# language and we'll see how to define similar 
    numeric type.</li>

  <li><strong>Static constraints.</strong> F# supports static member constraints, which can be used for writing functions that 
    work with any numeric type. For example, the <code>List.sum</code> function uses this feature. It 
    can sum elements of any list containing numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are just a few of the F# language features that are useful when writing numeric code, but
there are many others. The usual F# development style using interactive tools, type safety that
prevents common errors, units of measure as well the expressivity of F# make it a great tool for
writing numeric code. For more information, take a look at the MSDN overview article 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh304366.aspx">Writing Succinct and Correct Numerical Computations with F#</a>.

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-sequences.aspx/">Programming with F# asynchronous sequences</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/async-sequences/decor.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>In F#, we can represent asynchronous operations that do not block threads and eventually
  return a value of type <code>'T</code> using asynchronous workflows <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code>.
  Asynchronous workflows can be easily constructed using the computation expression syntax
  <code>async { ... }</code> and there are also a few combi&#173;nators that express more advanced
  composition (such as parallel composition or fork-join parallelism).</p>

<p>Sometimes, we need to use asynchronous operations that return more than just one value.
  For example, when downloading data from the internet, we would like to create an 
  <em>asynchronous sequence</em> that returns the data in chunks as they become available.</p>

<p>One way to represent asynchronous operations that produce multiple values is to use 
  the <code>IObservable&lt;'T&gt;</code> type from .NET. This isn't always the best option 
  though. Observables implement <em>push-based</em> model, which means that chunks of data are
  generated as quickly as possible (until all chunks are emitted). What if we wanted to take 
  the chunks one-by-one after the previous chunk is processed?</p>

<p>In this article, I describe <em>asynchronous sequences</em>. An asynchronous sequence is a simple,
  yet very powerful concept based on asynchronous workflows. It follows the same core model: results 
  are generated on demand and asynchronously. Unlike asynchronous workflows, asynchronous sequences
  can be called (on demand) to generate multiple values until the end of the sequence is reached.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">I first discussed asynchronous sequences with Don Syme, Dmitry Lomov and Brian McNamara in an
  email thread a long time ago. Thanks to Don for enthusiasm about the concept and for the 
  first implementation of some of the combinators!</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/real-world-book-msdn/msdn.jpg" style="float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 15px;" />
<p>More than a year ago, Mike Stephens from <a href="http://manning.com">Manning</a> (who
 was also behind my <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>
 book) asked me if I'd be interested in collaborating on a project for MSDN. The idea 
 was to collaborate with Microsoft on creating some additional content for the official
 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd233154(VS.100).aspx">F# Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the new content appeared on MSDN, so I finally have an excuse for the
  recent lack of blogging! Although the content contains a large number of new articles
  that are not based on my book, you can find it in the MSDN section named after my
  book, right under <em>Visual F#</em>. If you can't wait to check it out, here are all the links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh314518.aspx">Real-World Functional Programming</a> section on MSDN.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?query=tomas%20petricek&amp;f%5B0%5D.Value=tomas%20petricek&amp;f%5B0%5D.Type=SearchText&amp;ac=8">source code for individual chapters</a> is available on MSDN Code Gallery.</li>
  <li>I also published <a href="http://functional-programming.net/msdn/">annotated TOC with source code links</a> on my functional programming web site.</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on the articles, I also wrote about a few topics that we didn't use in the final version. You'll see them on my blog in the next few days, as soon as I edit them into a blog post form. <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/real-world-book-msdn.aspx">Continue reading</a> for more information about individual chapters.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/safe-gui-async.aspx/">Safer asynchronous workflows for GUI programming</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/safe-gui-async/screen.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 15px;" />

<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-non-blocking-gui.aspx">previous article</a>,
  I discussed how to use F# asynchronous work&#173;flows for creating reactive user-interfaces.
  One of the main concerns was to avoid blocking the GUI thread (to prevent the user-interface
  from freezing). The workflow shouldn't perform any CPU-intensive compu&#173;tation when running
  on the GUI thread.</p>

<p>The standard F# library provides two ways to run a computation on a background thread from
  an asynchronous workflow. The <code>StartChild</code> operation starts an operation 
  in the thread pool and returns a workflow that can be called using asynchronous (non-blocking)
  <code>let!</code> construct. The <code>SwitchToThreadPool</code> operation can be called
  using <code>do!</code> and resumes the rest of the workflow on a background thread.</p>

<p>When using the <code>SwitchToThreadPool</code> operation, we also need to eventually use
  <code>SwitchToContext</code> to transfer the execution back to the GUI thread (after 
  completing the CPU-intensive calculations). In this article, I describe a variation of 
  F# asynchronous workflows that keeps track of the running thread in the type of the 
  computation. As a result, calling a workflow that should be executed on a GUI thread 
  from a background thread is a compile-time error as opposed to failing at runtime.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/async-non-blocking-calls/screen.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 15px;" />

<p>F# asynchronous workflows are best known as a way to write efficient I/O operations
  or as an underlying mechanism of F# agent-based programming (using the <code>MailboxProcessor</code>
  type). However, they are also very useful for user-interface programming. I think this is 
  a very interesting and important area, so I already wrote and talked about this topic - 
  it is covered in <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/">Chapter 16 of my book</a> (there
  is a <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx">free excerpt</a>)
  and I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx">talked about it</a> at F#unctional Londoners
  meeting.</p>

<p>Many applications combine user-interface programming (such as waiting for an event asynchronously)
  with some CPU-intensive tasks. This article looks at an example of such application and I'll explain 
  how to avoid blocking the user-interface when doing the CPU-intensive task. 
  The article starts with an example that is wrong and blocks the user-interface when doing data processing.
  Then I'll show you two options for fixing the problem. The three most important
  functions from the standard F# library that I'll discuss are <code>Async.StartChild</code> and 
  <code>Async.SwitchTo&#173;ThreadPool</code> with <code>Async.SwitchToContext</code>.</p>

<p>This is the first article of a mini-series. In the next article, I'll demonstrate a simple
  wrapper for F# <code>async</code> that makes it more difficult to write <em>wrong</em> 
  programs. The wrapper keeps the desired thread (GUI or background) in the type of the 
  computations and code that would block the user interface will not type-check. But first,
  let's look at the example...</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-loosely-typed/goto.png" style="float:right;margin:0px 0px 15px 15px;" />

<p>About two weeks ago, I gave a talk at <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/">GOTO Conference</a> in
  Copenhagen at a very interesting .NET session organized by <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk /">Mark Seemann</a>.
  In my talk, I focused on the impedance mismatch between the data structures that are used
  in programming languages (such as classes in C# or records and discriminated unions in F#)
  and the data structures that we need to access (such as database, XML files and REST services).
   </p>

<p>Clearly, both of the sides have <em>some structure</em> (otherwise, it wouldn't be possible
  to write any code against them!). Even an XML file that is returned by a REST service has some
  structure - although the only way to find out about the structure may be to call the service
  and then look at the result. In this article, I'll briefly summarize the ideas that I 
  presented in the talk. Here are links to the slides as well as the source code from the 
  talk: </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-variations-joinads.aspx/">Variations in F#: Research compiler with Joinads and more!</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article, I'll write about an experimental extension for F# that I call 
  <em>joinads</em>. If you're following my blog, you may have seen an 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">academic paper</a> that
  I wrote about it some time ago. Anyway, the motivation for the extension
  is that there are many useful programming models for reactive, concurrent and parallel programming 
  that would deserve some syntactic support in the programming language.</p>

<p>For example, when programming with <em>futures</em> (the <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> type), 
  you may want to implement logical "or" operator for tasks that returns <code>true</code>
  immediately when the first task completes returning <code>true</code>. When programming with 
  <em>events</em> (the <code>IObservable&lt;T&gt;</code> type),
  we'd like to wait for the event that happens first. Finally, when programming using <em>agents</em>,
  we sometimes need to wait only for certain types of messages. All of these problems can
  be solved, but require the use of (sometimes fairly complicated) functions. Joinads make
  it possible to solve them directly using the <code>match!</code> syntax. For example, here
  is the "or" operator for tasks:</p>

<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="l">1: </span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs1', 1)" class="i">future</span> {
<span class="l">2: </span>  <span class="k">match!</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs2', 2)" class="i">after</span> <span class="n">100</span> <span class="k">true</span>, <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs2', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs2', 3)" class="i">after</span> <span class="n">1000</span> <span class="k">false</span> <span class="k">with</span>
<span class="l">3: </span>  | <span class="o">!</span><span class="k">true</span>, _ <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">true</span>
<span class="l">4: </span>  | _, <span class="o">!</span><span class="k">true</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">true</span>
<span class="l">5: </span>  | <span class="o">!</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs3', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs3', 4)" class="i">a</span>, <span class="o">!</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs4', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs4', 5)" class="i">b</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs3', 6)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs3', 6)" class="i">a</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs4', 7)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs4', 7)" class="i">b</span> }</pre>

<p>I'll write more about this example (and the implementation) in a later article. This article
  focuses on the compiler extension itself. I created a first implementation of the idea above during
  my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/internship-match-bang.aspx">internship with Don Syme at MSR Cambridge</a>,
  but then changed it quite a bit when writing the academic paper mentioned above. However, I never released
  the source code.
</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx">open-source release of F#</a> it is now 
  quite easy to modify the F# compiler and make the modifications available, so I decided I should 
  finally release my F# extensions. I also recently <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx">blogged</a>
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/formlets-in-linq.aspx">about</a> encoding <em>idioms</em> (also called
  <em>applicative functors</em>) in C#. I was wondering how to do that in F# and so I also created a simple
  extension computations based on this abstraction. The support for <em>idioms</em> is just an experiment, but it could 
  be useful, for example, for programming with formlets. You'll find more about it at the end of the 
  article.

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Extensions">source code on my GitHub</a>

  The source code is cloned from an F# Mono repository, which means that it should build on Linux and 
  MacOS too. </p>

<p>When writing F# programs, I often write some nice code snippet or some useful helper
  function that I'd like to share with the F# community. Unfortunately, my blog posts are
  usually longer and more elaborate, so I never get to blogging about it. Now that I have a 
  twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">follow me if you don't already</a>)
  I thought I could just post the snippet somewhere, but there was no 
  good web site for posting F# snippets - until now! </p>

<ul>
  <li>If you can't wait any further, then go directly to the new F# snippets web site at
  	<a href="http://fssnip.net">fssnip.net</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The web site uses my earlier project <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebsnippets-intro.aspx">F# Web Snippets</a> to format F# source
  code. It highlights colors and adds JavaScript tooltips using services provided by the
  F# compiler, which means that you'll get almost the same experience as when reading code
  in Visual Studio. I also wanted to make the page a repository of browsable snippets, so you can use
  it in two ways...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-compilation-internals.aspx/">Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</a></h1>
    
<p>Some time ago, I started writing a series about the differences between the asynchronous model in F# 
  (in Visual Studio 2010) and the asynchronous language extensions for C# proposed at PDC 2010.
  In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">first article</a>, I showed
  how both of the language features look and I highlighted a couple of differences. In the
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">second article</a>, I discussed
  the support for cancellation (available only in F#) and how the two models differ 
  <em>semantically</em> (i.e. what are differences in the behaviour). However, I didn't talk about more
  techincal differences and, in particular, how is the asynchronous code compiled. We'll look 
  at this topic today...</p>

<p>Although the C# asynchronous programming model is very similar to F# asynchronous workflows,
  the compilation looks quite different. The C# compiler uses a similar technique as when compiling
  iterators and creates a state machine, while the F# compiler uses an approach based on higher order
  functions (combinators) that's shared with (most) other computation expressions.</p>

<p>I won't discuss the syntax of F# asynchronous workflows or the C# asynchronous extensions in 
  this article, so if you're new to one of these, here are links to other articles in this 
  series: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (I.): Simultaneous introduction</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (II.): How do they differ?</a></li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</strong></li>
  <li>Asynchronous C# and F# (IV.): Calling F# libraries from C# <em>(not yet available)</em></li>
</ul>  

<p>Let's start by looking at the mechanism used in the C# compiler. If you already know how
  iterators work in C# 2.0, then you'll find it quite easy to understand. If you're not familiar
  with iterators, then don't worry - I'll make the explanation self-contained.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/monodevelop-update.aspx/">F# community on GitHub &amp; MonoDevelop update</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/monodevelop-update/github.png" class="rdecor" />
<p>When I talked with Miguel de Icaza and Michael Hutchinson at the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/fsharpined/">F# in Education
  workshop</a> some time ago, someone mentioned that it would be nice to have a clone
  of the official F# code drop that could accept patches from the community. 
  I also talked with Michael about <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and I 
  think I finally understood why everybody uses it today. I said to myself that
  I'll need to take a look at it when I'll have a bit of time...
  After coming back from the workshop, I was quite busy getting the F# plugin for
  MonoDevelop out, but after I wrote about it, I finally found some time to look
  at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I really like the way Mono team uses GitHub. They have a single "mono" organization
  that is owned by several people from the Mono community and all important projects
  that are parts of Mono have their repository as part of the "mono" organization. 
  Thanks to GitHub, everyone can easily clone the repository, do some changes and submit
  a "pull request" to the main repository.</p>

<p>I thought that the F# community could follow the same model, so I started the 
  <a href="https://github.com/fsharp">F# community organization</a> on GitHub...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-in-monodevelop.aspx/">F# in MonoDevelop and cross-platform web sites &amp; screencasts</a></h1>
    
<p>About a week ago, I attended the F# in Education workshop in Boston. It was a great event
  with many interesting people around. I believe that the workshop was very exciting for everyone who is
  interested in F#, but uses Mac or Linux. The F# team recently made some effort to improve the
  F# support on Mono (meaning mainly Mac and Linux). The recent <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/10/november-2010-f-2-0-free-tools-update.aspx" type="external">November 2010 CTP update</a>
  contains several bugfixes that make it possible to use F# on Mono 2.8. Another great thing 
  that happened at the workshop is the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx" type="external">open source release of F#</a>
  (see also <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Nov-11.html" type="external">blog post</a> by Miguel with a post-check-in photo).
  At the workshop, I also announced my contribution to the cross-platform F# story, a project that 
  I've been working on recently - <strong>the F# language binding
  for MonoDevelop.</strong>
  </p>

<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center;">
  <a target="_blank" href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-in-monodevelop/screen.png"><img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-in-monodevelop/screen-sm.png" style="border:0px;margin-bottom:5px" /></a><br />
  <a target="_blank" href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-in-monodevelop/screen.png"><small>Click here for a larger screenshot</small></a>
</div>
<p>I promised to make it available as soon as possible after the workshop. As usually, things take
  longer, than one would like, but I'm finally ready to announce the initial (beta) version of the 
  plugin. The screenshot on the right shows some of the features of the F# language binding. As you
  can see, there is an F# Interactive tool window, syntax highlighting as well as IntelliSense 
  auto-completion.</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying it out, here are links to the repository (you can use
  it to install the language binding from the MonoDevelop Add-ins manager) and source
  code. The F# plugin needs to be able to locate F# installation and it also requires 
  more F# assemblies to be installed in the GAC, so you may as well want to read the instructions
  before trying it :-).</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><a href="http://functional-variations.net/monodevelop/" type="external">Project homepage</a> at the Functional Variations 
    web site has more information about the project as well as detailed installation instructions.</li>
  <li>I also created a web page that contains information about <a href="http://functional-variations.net/crossplatform/" type="external">installing
    F# on Mac and Linux</a> which explains how to install F#, such that the MonoDevelop plugin can 
    find it.</li>
  <li>The source code is available in the <a href="http://fsxplat.codeplex.com/" type="external">F# cross-platform packages and samples</a> project at CodePlex
    (under the Apache 2.0 license). You can find it in the <code>monodevelop</code> subdirectory.</li>
  <li>Online repositiory with a MonoDevelop package is available at: <a href="http://functional-variations.net/addin">http://functional-variations.net/addin</a>.<br />
    <em>(If you're a hacker, the easiest way to get it working is to add <code>FSharp.Compiler*</code> to GAC and set <code>FSHARP_COMPILER_BIN</code> environment
    variable to F# installation location)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to see some interesting uses of the F# MonoDevelop plugin, you can also watch 
  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/fsharpined/videos.aspx" type="external">my 
  talk at the F# in Education event</a>. In one demo, I used F# on Mac to play with a simple, composable
  functional 3D library. In another example I demonstrated how to asynchronously process stock 
  prices on Linux. The last demo, showing my <code>match!</code> extension didn't work all that well, because
  I had too many virtual machines running, but I'll blog about <code>match!</code> again sooner or later!</p>

<p>In addition to the F# plugin for MonoDevelop itself, I'd also like to mention two web sites that
  I've been working on and some interesting cross-platform F# screencasts...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx/">Asynchronous C# and F# (II.): How do they differ?</a></h1>
    
<p>Anders Hejlsberg announced the support for asynchronous programming in the next version of C# announced at PDC 2010.
  The extension looks very similar to F# asynchronous workflows (which are already available in Visual Studio 2010). 
  Despite the large similarity, there are a couple of differences between the two programming models. I already mentioned 
  some of them briefly in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">the first article of this series</a>.
  In this article, we'll look at some of the technical differences between the two models.</p>

<p>The most notable non-technical difference is that F# asynchronous workflows are already available in a 
  supported version of Visual Studio and can be used on a large number of .NET runtimes (including, for example,
  Windows Phone and Silverlight). However, there are surprisingly many technical differences as well.
  In this article, I'll talk about the support for cancellation, which is available in F# and is not
  (currently) available in the C# preview. We'll also look at the difference between model where tasks
  are created as running and the delayed model.</p>

<p>This article is the second part of a short series about the asynchronous programming support
  in C# and F#. The previous article shows a simple example in both of the languages and the next
  articles explain how does the feature work (and how you can customize its behavior) as well as 
  how to call F# libraries from C#:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (I.): Simultaneous introduction</a></li>

  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-compilation-internals.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</a></li>
  <li>Asynchronous C# and F# (IV.): Calling F# libraries from C# <em>(not yet available)</em></li>
</ul>  
<p>Let's start by looking at, perhaps, the most important technical difference - the 
  built-in support for cancellation available in F# asynchronous workflows.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/csharp-fsharp-async-intro/pdc2010.png" style="float:right;margin:5px;margin-left:20px;" />
<p>One of the exciting new technologies that was announced at <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/">PDC 2010</a>
  is the support for <em>asynchronous programming</em> in C#. So what exactly is <em>asynchronous programming</em>?
  Many applications today need to connect to some service or external data source including, for example, 
  Web Services and REST APIs. These calls may take a long time to run, but we want to run them without
  blocking the application.</p>

<p>Currently, you can run the operation on a background thread or using a <code>Task</code>, but
  coordinating multiple such operations is difficult. What if you for example need to wait until
  any (or all) of downloads complete and run some more code then? This is not only difficult, but
  it also scales badly, because blocking .NET threads is a bad practice (Threads are expensive and when
  they're just waiting for other operation to complete, we're wasting valuable resources).
  This problem has been the main motivation for including <em>asynchronous workflows</em> in F#
  about 3 years ago. In F#, this also enabled various interesting programming styles - for example
  <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx" type="external">creating 
  GUI using asynchronous workflows</a> (also discussed in Chapter 16 of <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">my book</a> and in 
  in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx">my recent talk</a>). The C# asynchronous 
  programming support and the <code>await</code> keyword is largely inspired by
  F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em> (I was quite surprised that F# wasn't more visibly 
  mentioned in the PDC talk).
</p>

<p>In this article series, I'll demonstrate both F# and C# asynchronous programming model,
  I'll look at features that are missing in one or the other as well as a few subtle differences
  (that may be unexpected) and finally, I'll write about writing (asynchronous) F# libraries 
  that are easy to use from C#. The plan for the series is following:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-adash-cancellation.aspx/">F# Parallel Extras (III.): Financial dashboard with cancellation</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article we'll look at several improvements that can be done to the Financial dashboard example
  (originally from the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a> book).
  When I was translating samples in the book from C# to F#, the sample struck me, because it looks like
  a perfect fit for F# asynchronous workflows (instead of the <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> type used in the
  C# version). I already talked about an <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-adash.aspx">alternative 
  implementation</a> based on asynchronous workflows. However that version was still following some of the
  programming patterns, from the original C# version, which are not idiomatic in F#. In this article, I'll talk
  about a few other improvements that we can make to the sample...</p>

<p>In the original version of the sample (in both C# and F#), we explicitly checked whether a cancellation
  token has been cancelled in every single operation. This was needed in C#, because tasks do not support
  cancellation automatically. However, F# asynchronous workflows make cancellation easier. They automatically
  check if the computation should be cancelled at the beginning and the end of every asynchronous call. Our
  first change will be to use this feature. Also, the original version propagates a <code>null</code> value
  when the computation is cancelling. In F# we don't need that and we'll only change the type of the overall
  result to <code>option&lt;T&gt;</code>, so that we can notify the user interface (but we don't need to 
  propagate cancellation explicitly). Finally, the original version contained sequential implementation, but
  didn't provide any way of actually running it, so we'll do a bit of refactoring to make that sample 
  actually useable.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-blockingagent.aspx/">F# Parallel Extras (II.): Agent-based blocking queue</a></h1>
    
<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-image-pipeline.aspx">previous article</a>, we 
  briefly introduced the <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> type and we used it to implement the
  pipeline pattern (from Chapter 7 of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>)
  using asynchronous workflows. The type was used to represent intermediate buffers with a limited size.
  In this article we'll take a look at the implementation of the type. The type implements a very useful
  pattern in agent-based parallel programming, so you can use it in your work, but it could be also 
  interesting as a demonstration of the F# <code>Agent&lt;T&gt;</code> type (an recommended alias 
  for the <code>MailboxProcessor&lt;T&gt;</code> type).</p>
<p>The <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> type is similar to <code>BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> 
  from .NET 4.0. It has methods for adding and removing elements that block when the operation cannot be
  done (e.g. adding when the queue is full or removing when the queue is empty). The most important 
  difference is that it can be used <em>asynchronously</em>. This means that when we call its operations
  form F# asynchronous workflow (using <code>let!</code> and <code>do!</code>), the operation will block
  the calling workflow, but it will not block any physical thread. We start by looking at the overall
  structure of the agent and then look at the body of the agent which implements its behavior (using
  a state machine)...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-image-pipeline.aspx/">F# Parallel Extras (I.): Image pipeline using agents</a></h1>
    
<p>In a <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-samples.aspx">recent blog post series</a>,
  I wrote about parallel programming samples that accompany the 
  <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>
  book by patterns &amp; practices group at Microsoft. The F# translation of the samples that I
  wrote about mostly followed the style used in the book, so it used patterns that 
  are typical for C#. However, some of the samples can be written in F# in a more interesting way...</p>
<p>In this article, we'll take a look at agent-based implementation of the Image pipeline 
  example (from chapter 7). A <em>pipeline</em> is a useful pattern if you need to process large
  number of inputs in parallel and the processing consists of multiple phases or steps. In the
  original implementation, the pipeline was implemented using <code>BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>
  and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> types from .NET 4.0.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll show a 
  version that uses F# agents and asynchronous workflows. We'll use a <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> 
  type, which is <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-blockingagent.aspx">discussed in another 
  article</a>. It represents a queue with limited capacity that asynchronously blocks the process that is adding 
  values if there is no space in the buffer and blocks the process that reads values when there are no 
  values. This type can be elegantly used to implement the pipeline pattern. In this article, we'll 
  demonstrate it by writing a four-phase pipeline that processes images. As you'll see, 
  the agent-based version of the code is very much easier to write and has similar performance as 
  the original version.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx/">Reactive, parallel and concurrent programming in F# (PADL 2011)</a></h1>
    
<p>Don Syme blogged about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/10/21/the-f-asynchronous-programming-model-padl-2010-pre-publication-draft.aspx" type="extenal">
  a paper on the F# Asynchrounous Programming Model</a> that I helped to write. Without any doubt,
  the asynchronous programming features of F# are one of the reason for its success and also 
  influence other teams in Microsoft. However, I'm very glad that there is now also an academic
  paper that makes this idea accessible to the academic community. I believe that the ideas could
  evolve in interesting ways when used in other programming languages and also, it is now easier to 
  create research projects that build on top of the F# model.</p>

<p>Don already mentioned that we have another paper accepted at PADL. The paper describes work 
  that started during my internship at Microsoft Research in 2009. It presents a simple 
  language extension for <em>computation expressions</em> that makes them even more useful 
  in some reactive, concurrent and parallel programming models. Note that this is only a 
  research project and there are currently no plans to support the extension in the F# language
  (although, if there will, eventually, be an open-source F# release, then you'll hear about the 
  extension again...)</p>

<p>Here is the abstract of the paper (accepted at <a href="http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/PADL-2011/">PADL 2011</a>) and a PDF download link:</p>

<h3 style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;">Joinads: A retargetable control-flow construct for reactive, parallel and concurrent programming</h3>

<p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
  Modern challenges led to a design of a wide range of programming models for reactive, parallel 
  and concurrent programming, but these are often difficult to encode in general purpose languages. 
  We present an abstract type of computations called joinads together with a syntactic language 
  extension that aims to make it easier to use joinads in modern functional languages. </p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
  Our extension generalizes pattern matching to work on abstract computations. It keeps a familiar 
  syntax and semantics of pattern matching making it easy to reason about code, even in a 
  non-standard programming model. We demonstrate our extension using three important programming 
  models – a reactive model based on events; a concurrent model based on join calculus and a 
  parallel model using futures. All three models are implemented as libraries that benefit from 
  our syntactic extension. This makes them easier to use and also opens space for exploring new 
  useful programming models.</p>

</ul>

<p>The paper can still be revised before the final publication, so any comments and suggestions
  for improvement are largely welcome. You can contact me either via comments (below) or using 
  email at <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>. I would be also quite interested
  to hear from anybody who would like to implement similar feature in other programming languages
  (for example Haskell or Scala).</p>

<p>Languages with type-inference make it possible to write shorter code, because a smart
  compiler infers the types automatically. Even though we don't write the types, they are
  still there and are used to check whether our code doesn't contain (certain type of) bugs.
  However, types are not only useful for safety, but also when understanding code. When you 
  see a function together with its type (especially higher-order functions) you can understand
  code much more easily than when you just see its name.
  When writing F# code, you can see all the types thanks to great integration for Visual Studio.
  However, what if you post a code sample to a web site or a blog? Many F# code snippets (including
  some on this blog) are just difficult to read without types. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was talking with James Margetson (from the F# team) about the possible uses
  of some functionality provided by the F# compiler and he suggested that we could use them
  to solve the problem I described in the introduction. Wouldn't it be nice if you could place a 
  mouse cursor over an identifier in an F# blog post and see the same type information as the 
  one that would appear in Visual Studio? </p>

<p>Here is an example of what I'm talking about: </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-adash.aspx/">Parallel Programming in F# (IV.): Financial dashboard example</a></h1>
    
<p>In the fourth part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll take a look at the Adatum Financial 
  Dashboard sample. The sample is a part of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>, which is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide, but the F# translation
  contains several additional interesting aspects that I'll introduce in this article.</p>

<p>The sample simulates a financial modelling application that performs processing of market
  data in several steps that can be partly executed in parallel. In this article we'll compare two
  implementations. The first one (similar to the C# version) uses the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type 
  from .NET 4.0 and chains steps using the <code>ContinueWith</code> method. The second version is 
  F# specific and it implements step as a sequential computation wrapped in asynchronous 
  workflows. Partial results are reported to the user interface using events.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-aggregate.aspx/">Parallel Programming in F# (III.): Aggregating data</a></h1>
    
<p>In this part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll explore examples of parallel aggregation 
  from Chapter 4 of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>, which is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide. In this article,
  we'll look at the F# translation and in particular at several functions from the <code>PSeq</code>
  module. Some of the functionality is currently available only in the "PSeq.fs" distributed with the
  samples, but will eventually appear in F# PowerPack as well. </p>

<p>Aggregation of data in parallel is an interesting problem. As we've seen in the previous article, 
  PLINQ and tasks make it easy to parallelize independent blocks of code that don't share any state.
  Unfortunatelly, not all programs are like that. In particular, we often need to aggregate all
  elements of a sequence - when writing sequential code in F#, you would use the <code>Seq.fold</code>
  function. In this article, we'll look at functions that implement fold parallel.</p>

<p>In this part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll look at some basic examples of parallel 
  programming in F# that are available in <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>. This is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The guide discusses the samples in C#, but it also contains an F# translation of the source
  code. Since the languages are different, the F# version deserves a brief explanation.</p>
  
<p>In this article, we'll discuss some of the F# examples and we'll look at a couple of aspects that
  are specific for F#. In particular, we'll look at working with Parallel LINQ (both directly and using
  <code>PSeq</code> module from F# PowerPack) and working with tasks. We'll also look at an interesting 
  example (using closures) where C# version doesn't behave as expected, but a literal translation in F# corrects the 
  problem.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-parallel-samples/book.png" style="float:right;margin:20px;"/>
<p><a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a> is a 
  guide written by the patterns &amp; practices group at Microsoft. It introduces .NET programmers to
  patterns for including parallelism in their applications (using support for parallel programming in
  .NET 4.0). It introduces techniques such as parallel loops, parallel tasks, data aggregation and so on.
  The book includes numerous samples in C# and Visual Basic that can be easily copied and adapted 
  to match your needs.</p>

<p>As part of a contracting work for the F# team, I developed an F# version of the samples, which is 
  now available on the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">book web site</a>.
  You can get it by downloading <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/releases/view/50473">F# code samples</a> (ZIP) from the 1.0 release, or you can download the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets" 
  type="external">latest version of the source code</a> directly. The F# version of the
  code is mostly a direct translation of the C# versions, but there are a few interesting places that
  are worth discussing. In particular, some of the samples use the <code>PSeq</code> module from F#
  PowerPack and I also added a version of one example that uses F# asynchronous workflows.</p>

<p>In this article series, I'll look at several interesting examples from the F# version of the source code.
  We'll look how to use PLINQ and Tasks (which are available in .NET 4.0) from F# (Part II.) including some advanced topics such 
  as the Map-Reduce algorithm (Part III.). We'll also look at a larger example built using tasks and an alternative 
  implementation using asynchronous workflows (Part IV.) Here are links to the individual articles:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-sql.aspx/">Dynamic in F#: Reading data from SQL database</a></h1>
    
<p>When reading data from a SQL database in F#, you have a couple of options.
  You can use F# implementation of LINQ, which allows you to write queries directly
  in the F# language or you can use standard ADO.NET classes such as <code>SqlCommand</code>.
  The second option is often good enough - when you just need to call a simple 
  query, you probably don't want to setup the whole LINQ infrastructure (generate
  classes, reference F# PowerPack, etc.) Unfortunately, ADO.NET classes are a bit
  ugly to use. When calling an SQL stored procedure, you need to specify the name
  of the procedure as a string, you need to add parameters one-by-one by creating
  instances of <code>SqlParameter</code>, you need to dynamically cast results from 
  the <code>obj</code> type and so on...</p>

<p>In this article, we'll look how to use the <em>dynamic operator</em> to make the
  experience of using ADO.NET from F# dramatically better. Dynamic operator (there are
  actually two of them) are a simple way of supporting dynamic invoke in F#. We can use
  it to write code that looks almost like an ordinary method call or property access,
  but is resolved dynamically at runtime (using the name of the method or property).
  The following example shows what we'll be able to write at the end 
  of this article:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// Call 'GetProducts' procedure with 'CategoryID' set to 1
use conn = new DynamicSqlConnection(connectionString)
use cmd = conn?GetProducts
cmd?CategoryID &lt;- 1
conn.Open()

// Read all products and print their names
use reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
while reader.Read() do
  printfn "Product: %s" reader?ProductName
</pre>

<p>If you ever tried to call a SQL stored procedure directly using the 
  <code>SqlCommand</code>, then you can surely appreciate the elegance of this code
  snippet. Let's now take a look at a larger example and some of the neat 
  tricks that make this possible...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx/">Recording and samples from my Reactive F# talk</a></h1>
    
<p>Almost a week ago, I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fun-londoners-reactive.aspx">posted an invitation</a> to my 
  F# talk at the F#unctional Londoners user group. The theme of my talk was <em>reactive programming</em>, which 
  was also a topic of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/reactive-thesis.aspx">Master's thesis</a> (defended
  earlier in June), so I really enjoyed talking about it. In the talk, I discussed the two approaches that you can 
  use for developing reactive applications in F# (using examples in Silverlight):
</p>

</a>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Declarative</strong> (or <em>data-flow</em> oriented) allows you to describe "what" should be 
    done with data that your component receives from various events (such as mouse position etc.) This can 
    be written using F# event combinators such as <code>Event.map</code> and <code>Event.scan</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Imperative</strong> (or <em>control-flow</em> oriented) - in this style, we describe various
    states of the component (e.g. semaphore with green, orange and red) and describe transitions between the
    states. This can be written using F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and the <code>AwaitObservable</code>
    primitive (which you can get as part of the source code).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to the folks from <a href="http://skillsmatter.com">SkillsMatter</a> who provided place for the meetup
  and helped with the organization, the talk was also recorded and is already available online! Below, you can also 
  get all the nice Silverlight demos that I used during the talk...</p>

<h2>Reactive Programming with F#</h2>
<p>I'm sure you're already convinced to come. Nevertheless, you may still want to know 
  what I'm going to talk about. There are many areas where F# offers clear benefits such as
  parallel &amp; concurrent programming. I believe that <strong>reactive programming</strong>
  is another great area for F#. In reactive programming, we face quite different problems than
  in other programming styles. We (as the authors of the application) can no longer specify what
  the application should do. Instead, the application needs to be able to handle many possible
  combinations of events. This aspect of programming is sometimes called <em>inversion of control</em>.</p>
<p>Reactive programming is important for programming user interfaces, especially today when
  user interfaces are becoming more interactive and more "fancy". To demonstrate this, I'm working on some nice <strong>Silverlight</strong> demos for the talk! However, it is also needed
  to handle other kinds of events such as completion of background task or message from 
  other application. We'll look at the two essential techniques that F# provides for reactive
  programming:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Declarative event combinators</strong> - one way of writing reactive applications
    is to specify the whole event processing declaratively by saying "what" should be done with 
    occurrences of events. This is particularly useful when we need to encode simpler
    logic with a clear <em>data-flow</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Imperative using workflows</strong> - for more complicated interactions, we can
    use <em>asynchronous workflows</em>. This makes the code more explicit, but we get full 
    control over the <em>control-flow</em> of the application. Even though this approach is 
    more "imperative" it can be used for writing nicely composable functional code as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing you at the talk next week!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-mvc-web.aspx/">ASP.NET and F# (I.) - Creating MVC web applications in F#</a></h1>
    
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a couple of examples of <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-in-fsharp.aspx">
  developing web applications in F# using ASP.NET</a>. Since then, the F# language and runtime has changed
  a little bit and there are also new technologies available in ASP.NET, so I thought I'd write a more
  up-to-date article on this topic. In this article, I'll present a simple "demo" F# web application that
  you can use as a starting point when creating your own projects (you'll also find a convenient Visual
  Studio 2010 template below). The article shows the following interesting things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong> - We're going to use ASP.NET MVC Framework to create the web
    application. As the article name suggests, most of the actual program code including models and
    controllers will be implemented in F#.</li>
  <li><strong>F# LINQ to SQL</strong> - The application uses a sample Northwind database and we'll
    write queries for selecting data from the database using LINQ support that's available in the
    <a href="http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/" type="external">F# PowerPack</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>F# features</strong> - The application also uses some nice F# features that are 
    quite useful for developing web applications. We'll use modules and records to implement the
    model and we'll also use advanced meta-programming features for constructing LINQ queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use F# for creating an MVC application, you have a few options. It should be 
  possible to create the web application solely as an F# project. However, we'll use a more convenient
  approach. We'll create a standard C# MVC project and move all the actual implementation to 
  an F# library. We'll look at the application structure shortly. The following screenshot shows
  a page that lists products in the Northwind database:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/excerpt-gui-workflows.aspx/">Programming user interfaces using F# workflows</a></h1>
    
<p>Numerous Manning partners already published several exceprts from my <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/" target="external">Real-World Functional Programming</a> book. You can find a list on the <a href="http://functional-programming.net/" type="external">book's web page</a>. However, the last excerpt published <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx" type="external">at DotNetSlackers</a> is particularly interesting. It discusses how to use F# asynchronous workflows to write GUI applications. This is a very powerful programming pattern that is very difficult to do in any other .NET language. We first discussed it with Don Syme during my internship at Microsoft Research and I found it very elegant, so I made some space for it in the book. In fact, the entire Chapter 16 discusses various reactive programming techniques that can be used in F#.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/excerpt-gui-workflows/app.png" style="margin:15px;float:right;" />
<p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">When designing applications that don't react to external events, you have lots of control flow constructs available, such as if-then-else expressions, for loops and while loops in imperative languages, or recursion and higher-order functions in functional languages. Constructs like this make it easy to describe what the application does. The control flow is clearly visible in the source code, so drawing a flowchart to describe it is straightforward.</p>

<p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">Understanding reactive applications is much more difficult. A typical C# application or GUI control that needs to react to multiple events usually involves mutable state. When an event occurs, it updates the state and may run more code in response to the event, depending on the current state. This architecture makes it quite difficult to understand the potential states of the application and the transitions between them. Using asynchronous workflows, we can write the code in a way that makes the control flow of the application visible even for reactive applications.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx/">Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article series, we're talking about the Accelerator project and I'm 
  presenting an F# library that I implemented, which allows you to use Accelerator [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx#accelfsh4links">references</a>]
  in a more sophisticated way. We've seen two examples of using Accelerator directly
  (see also <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">introduction</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">Game of Life</a>).
  In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx">previous article</a>
  I introduced my F# library for working with Accelerator. We've seen F# functions from the
  <code>DataParallel</code> module, we implemented an algorithm that rotates an image
  using these functions and finally, we've seen that we can take this ordinary F# code
  and run it using Accelerator. This is all possible thanks to F# quotations, which 
  we can use to get an AST (a source code) of an F# function we wrote (if the function
  is marked in some special way).</p>
  
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-quotations/blur.png" alt="Blurred photo of Prague" style="float:right; margin:10px" />
<p>In this part of the series, we're going to look at working with quotations explicitly.
  We'll use meta-programming techniques to work with Accelerator. Meta-programming means
  writing programs that manipulate with other programs or pieces of code. This is exactly
  what we're going to do in this article. We'll write an F# function (running on CPU) that
  builds a program, which we'll then run using Accelerator.</p>
<p>This is quite interesting approach, which isn't possible when we call Accelerator
  methods as standard F# functions or .NET methods. The benefit is that we'll 
  clearly see which parts of program run on CPU and what parts execute on GPU or using
  X64 multi-core target. We could also perform more complicated optimizations with 
  the code (because this wouldn't affect the readability). Just for your reference, here is the list
  of articles in this series in case you missed some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">Accelerator and F# (I.): Introduction and calculating PI</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">Accelerator and F# (II.): The Game of Life on GPU</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx">Accelerator and F# (III.): Data-parallel programs using F# quotations</a></li>
  <li><strong>Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations</strong></li>
</ul>  
<p>However, enough with theory and let's take a look at some code samples! 
  This time, we'll implement blurring of an image (also called convolution). 
  Another example how to write this in F# using Accelerator is Satnam Singh's blog 
  post [<a href="#accelfsh4links">4</a>]. Our example will be different, because we'll
  write the code as standard F# program and then have it translated to Accelerator
  automatically using quotations. We'll also talk about the architecture
  of the library that we're using and look at some performance results.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx/">Accelerator and F# (III.): Data-parallel programs using F# quotations</a></h1>
    
<p>If you've been following this article series, you already know 
  that Accelerator is a MSR library [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx#accelfsh3links">1</a>, <a href="#accelfsh3links">2</a>] 
  that allows you to run code in parallel on either multi-core CPU or using 
  shaders on GPU (see <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">introduction</a>).
  We also discussed a direct way to use Accelerator from F# (by calling Accelerator methods
  directly) and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">implemented Conway's Game of Life</a>.
  In this article, we'll look at more sophisticated way of using Accelerator from F#.
  We'll introduce F# quotations and look at translating 'normal' F# code to use
  Accelerator.</p>
  
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-dataparallel/rotated.png" alt="Rotated Prague photo" style="float:right; margin:10px" />

<p>In general, F# quotations allow us to treat F# code as data structure and manipulate 
  with it. This is very similar to C# expression trees, but the F# implementation is 
  more powerful. We can also mark a standard method or a function with a special attribute
  that tells the compiler to store quotation of the body. Then we can access the
  quotation and traverse it or modify it. In this article we'll use a function that
  takes an F# quotation (containing a limited set of functions) and executes it using
  MSR Accelerator. Implementing this functionality is a bit complicated, so we won't
  discuss the implementation now. We'll leave this for some future article of this series.
  In future, we'll also look at other interesting possibilities that we have when 
  writing code using quotations. Here is a list of articles in this series and of the
  articles that I'm planning to add:</p>

<p>In the <a href="accelerator-intro.aspx">previous article</a>, I introduced the
  Microsoft Research Accelerator library. It allows us to write computations with arrays
  in C# and execute them in parallel on multi-core CPU or more interestingly, 
  using GPU shaders. In the previous artcile, we've seen how Accelerator works and 
  how it can be accessed from F#. In this article, we'll look at one more interesting
  F# demo - we'll implement the famous Conway's Game of Life [<a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx#accelfsh2links">1</a>] using Accelerator.
  We'll use a v2 version of Accelerator which has been announced just recently and
  is available from Microsoft Connect [<a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx#accelfsh2links">2</a>].</p>

<p>This article is the second one from a series about using Accelerator from F#. 
  Today, we'll use Accelerator types directly from F# - this is the simplest possible 
  approach and is very similar to the way you'd work with Accelerator in C#. However, 
  we can use some nice F# features such as custom operators to make the code more 
  readable. In the next article, we'll discuss a different approach - we'll look how
  to execute more "standard" F# code (that doesn't reference Accelerator explicitly)
  with Accelerator using F# quotations. The list of articles may change, but here is 
  a list of articles that I'm currently planning to write:</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-intro/montecarlo.png" alt="Calculating Pi using Monte-Carlo" style="float:left; margin:10px" />
<p>I already wrote about two projects that I worked on during an internship at
  MSR back in 2007 (<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-in-fsharp.aspx" type="external">ASP.NET support in F#</a> and
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebtools-intro.aspx" type="external">F# WebTools</a>).
  Even though this was more than 2 years ago (and I did one more internship at MSR in the meantime),
  I still have one more project that I never published on the web. The folks from the F# team
  reminded me of this project recently, so I thought I could finally publish it. The project 
  used Microsoft Research Accelerator [<a href="#accelfsh1links">1</a>, <a href="#accelfsh1links">2</a>], 
  which is a C# library for developing array-based computations and executing them on a GPU. 
  More recently, the Accelerator team at MSR published Accelerator v2 [<a href="#accelfsh1links">3</a>],
  which was a good motivation to update my original project...</p>
  
<p>In this article, we'll look at the simplest way of using Accelerator from F#. Accelerator
  provides a managed interface that can be naturally used from both C# and F#. We can use
  a mix of method calls and overloaded operators to describe a computation. In F#, we'll also 
  define our additional custom operators to make the code a bit nicer. After we introduce
  Accelerator using a simple C# demo, we'll look how to calculate an approximate value of
  the PI number using a Monte-Carlo method.</p>
<p>This article is the first one from a series about using Accelerator from F#. The list
  of articles may change, but here is a list of articles that I'm currently planning to write:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-webcast-objects.aspx/">F# Webcast (IV.) - Developing standard .NET libraries</a></h1>
    
<p>In the previous parts of this webcast series we've developed an F# script that downloads RSS feeds
  asynchronously and in parallel and searches them for the specified keywords. We followed the usual F#
  development style, so after introducing <a href="fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">the basic functional 
  concepts</a>, we wrote the code in <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the simples possible style</a> 
  and demonstrated how to use <code>System.Xml</code> and <code>System.Net</code> namespaces. Then we 
  <a href="fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">refactored the existing code</a>, to run asynchronously and process
  the results potentially in parallel, which was very easy thanks to F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em>.</p>

<p>In this part of the series, we'll make the next evolutionary step of our sample application. We'll turn
  the code that originally used F# tuples and lists into code that uses standard .NET objects and we'll
  also see how to declare a class in F#. This simple modification will turn the script into an F# library
  that is almost indistinguishable from a library developed in C#. We'll also look how you can use the library
  from C# web application to show the interop between C# and F# in practice. We'll start
  with the code from the <a href="fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">previous part</a>, so if you missed that, you
  may want to check it out or download the source code.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-webcast-async.aspx/">F# Webcast (III.) - Using Asynchronous Workflows</a></h1>
    
<p>In this webcast, we'll look at improving the code for downloading and
  processing RSS feeds that I presented in <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the second part</a> 
  (if you didn't see earlier parts, <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the first one</a> was an introduction to 
  basic functional ideas). The previous part demonstrated how to use .NET libraries
  and we implemented a simple <code>downloadUrl</code> function for obtaining content
  of from the web and we've also seen how to load the data into an XML document object
  and how to filter items. In this part, we'll modify the code to run asynchronously and 
  potentially in parallel. To use some of the functionality, you'll need to get 
  <code>FSharp.PowerPack.dll</code>, which is available with the VS 2008 installation or
  as a separated download for VS 2010 [<a href="#fswc_asy">4</a>].
</p>

<p>Now that we have the first version of the code, we can start <em>refactoring</em> it.
  I'm using the term in a slightly vague meaning - we're of course going to change the
  behavior of the code. We'll wrap it into F# <em>asynchronous workflow</em> to run
  without blocking threads and we'll also run multiple downloads in parallel. However,
  this can still be viewed as refactoring in some sense, because we're not changing
  the <em>core</em> behavior of the code. As you can see from the webcast, these kinds of
  refactorings are also very nicely supported by F# syntax...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx/">F# Webcast (II.) - Using .NET libraries</a></h1>
    
<p>About a week ago I posted <a href="fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">the first part</a> of my F# webcast series.
  It focused on explainining the basic ideas behind functional programming such as immutability, recursion
  and passing functions as arguments to other functions (or methods in C#). In the first part, we've seen some
  C# code to demonstrate the ideas and also a bit of F#, mainly to show the basic language features.
</p>

<p>The second part is going to be exclusively about F#. It'll demonstrate how we can start writing
  a demo application that grabs data from RSS feeds and processes them. You'll learn how to access
  .NET libraries from F# (in particular, we'll use <code>System.Net</code> and <code>System.Xml</code>).
  We'll develop the code iteratively, which means that we'll start by simply enumerating the RSS elements using <code>for</code> loop and printing the results and then we'll refactor the code to use <em>tuples</em> and <em>sequence expressions</em> to turn it into processing code that generates a sequence of feed items. Finally we'll also demonstrate how to use some of the functions from the previous part such as <code>List.filter</code> in practice.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx/">F# Webcast (I.) - Introducing functional concepts</a></h1>
    
<p>Now that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010/default.mspx" type="external">Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1</a> is out, it is finally a good time to take a look at 
  one of the (in my opinion) most interesting new features in the new release - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2009/05/20/visual-studio-2010-beta1-with-f-is-now-available-plus-matching-f-ctp-update-for-vs2008.aspx" type="external">the F# language</a>. F# existed for
  quite a long time now as Microsoft Research project, but is now becoming a real Microsoft product.
  Interestingly, F# is still available as a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=7bb32f32-9fac-4f34-ad56-b0bda130cf00" type="external">plugin for Visual Studio 2008</a>, so if you want to try it
  you don't have to install the whole new beta of 2010.</p>

<p>There are already many resources for learning F# including my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-overview.aspx">functional programming overview</a>,
  which is a Manning Greenpaper for the book <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" type="external">Functional Programming for the Real World</a> that I'm writing with Jon Skeet
  and my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-i-introduction.aspx">four-part F# introduction</a>. There are also some useful links on the 
  official <a href="http://www.fsharp.net">F# web site</a> including some talk recordings. However, I haven't yet seen any good F# webcast focusing 
  mainly on showing F# source code, starting from simple functional concepts to the real-world features like asynchronous workflows and object-oriented 
  programming in F#, so I decided to create one.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-ii-break.aspx/">Imperative computation in F# (II.) - Writing break and continue</a></h1>
    
<p>As I already wrote in the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-i-return.aspx">first part of this series</a>,
  the F# language doesn't support some of the language constructs known from imperative
  languages such as C#. In particular, we cannot use imperative <code>return</code> statement
  that returns the result of a function from any place in the function code. In functional languages,
  every construct is an expression, so to get the overall result of the function, the 
  F# language evaluates the expression and the value of the expression is used as the result.
  In the previous article, we've seen that we can simulate this construct in the F# language
  using F# computation expressions and I showed how to implement computation named <code>imperative</code>
  that allows us to write for example the <code>exists</code> function for working with sequences
  like this:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
let exists f inp = imperative {
  for v in inp do 
    if f(v) then return true
  return false }
</pre>  
<p>In this article, we're going to look at two more imperative constructs and we're going
  to talk about <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>. We'll see that we can quite
  easily extend the computation builder from the previous article to allow writing code
  that is syntactically very close to what you would write in C#. As I already mentioned,
  there are of course some performance overheads when using computation expressions, but 
  I find it very interesting how nice imperative syntax we can get in functional F#:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
imperative { 
  for x in 1 .. 10 do 
    if (x % 3 = 0) then do! continue
    printfn "number = %d" x }
</pre>  
<p>The only difference between this code and the code we'd probably write if F# supported
  <code>continue</code> as a keyword is that we need to wrap the code inside the <code>imperative</code>
  computation and that we need to add the <code>do!</code> primitive before the <code>continue</code>
  value. Now that we've seen an example of using the <code>continue</code> value inside
  the imperative computations, let's look how we can extend the computation builder from
  the previous article to add this feature...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-i-return.aspx/">Imperative computation in F# (I.) - Returning results from a function</a></h1>
    
<p>One of the limitations of F# is that it doesn't very well support some of the 
  advanced imperative language constructs such as <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>
  or imperative style of returning value from a function, meaning that you can't write
  something like <code>return false</code> in the middle of the function. This has 
  good reasons. F# doesn't in principle have the notion of <em>currently executing statement</em>
  and instead treat every code you write as an expression. Clearly, when there is no 
  <em>current statement</em>, we cannot jump to other statements. If you're looking
  for more information about these basic principles, you can take a look at my book 
  <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external">Real World Functional 
  Programming</a>, which covers this distinction in details in chapter 2, but we'll look 
  at a brief example that will clarify this idea shortly.</p>

<p>Often, there is really no need to use <code>break</code> or other imperative constructs
  in F#, because you can write the same thing more elegantly using one of the provided higher
  order function such as <code>Seq.exists</code> or <code>Seq.tryfind</code>. However,
  there are still some cases where the imperative programming style makes it easier 
  to express our original intention. Also, implementing your own higher order
  functions (akin to <code>Seq.exists</code>) would sometimes be much easier if we
  could just use imperative return.</p>  
<p>So, what can be done about this?</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-overview.aspx/">Functional Programming in .NET using C# and F# (Manning Greenpaper)</a></h1>
    
<p>
  Functional programming languages have been around for a while and were always astonishing for their 
  ability to express the ideas in a succinct, declarative way allowing the developer to focus on the 
  essence of problem rather than on technical details of the solution. Recently, functional paradigm is 
  gaining new prominence as an efficient way to handle development of multi-processor, parallel and 
  asynchronous applications.</p>

<p>
  Functional ideas are arising in C# as well as in other main-stream languages and functional languages 
  are becoming an alternative for real-world projects.  Also, Microsoft recently introduced a new 
  language called F#, which has a strong background in traditional functional languages, but as a .NET 
  language also benefits from the rich .NET and Visual Studio ecosystem.</p>

<p>
  This article is partially an excerpt from my book <strong><a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a></strong> [<a href="#fpgpref">1</a>]. 
  Thanks to my editors at <a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external">Manning</a> I have the permission
  to publish it on my blog. We’ll look at several aspects of functional programming and how the same 
  concepts, which are essential for the functional paradigm, look in the F# and in C# 3.0 with LINQ. We 
  will shortly look at the basic programming language features like lambda functions and type inference 
  that are now available in both F# and C#. Functional programming isn’t only about language features, 
  but also about using different programming style, so we’ll look at some high level concepts as well. 
  These include using immutable data structures for developing code that can be executed in parallel 
  and writing code in a more declarative style.</p>

<p>
  Thanks to the combination of C# 3.0 and F#, this article shows the ideas in a way that should be 
  familiar to you in C#, but also shows a further step that you can take with a primarilly functional
  language F#. If you're a .NET developer and you want to understand what functional programming is
  and how it can help you to become better and more productive then continue reading. If you'll find 
  this article interesting, then don't forget to check out the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">book</a>,
  which explains everything in larger detail and discusses many other interesting ideas.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-i-fsevents.aspx/">Reactive programming (I.) - First class events in F#</a></h1>
    
<p>I believe that the LINQ project and changes in C# 3.0 and VB 9 are interesting because they 
  allow rewriting of many ideas from functional programming. An ability to express queries easily
  is one of these ideas, but it is definitely not the only one. There are many other interesting ideas.
  The C# 3.0 language isn't primary a functional language, so it isn't easy to discover the idea
  if you use only C#, but it is possible to implement it if you know the idea already.</p>
<p>I already wrote a few interesting C# examples that were inspired by some functional idea.
  I'm a big fan of the F# language, so it is not a surprise that I started with an F# version
  of the problem and then looked at the way to do the same thing in C#. In particular, this is 
  how my article about building dynamic queries in C# came to the existence - the F# version used
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-flinq.aspx">FLINQ and Quotations</a> and then I demonstrated how to do the same in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx">C# 
  using expression trees</a>. Another example is my article about asynchronous 
  programming in C# <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx">using iterators</a>, which shows how to implement something 
  like F# <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/11/introducing-f-asynchronous-workflows.aspx">asynchronous workflows using iterators</a> in C# 2.0.</p>

<h3>Functional Reactive Programming</h3>  
<p>Today, I'm going to look at another very interesting idea from functional programming. It is 
  called <em>Functional Reactive Programming</em> and it comes from the Haskell community. You can find 
  a list of related <a href="http://www.haskell.org/frp/" type="external">Haskell projects here</a>.
  However, similar things (though they are not purely functional and simplified) are available 
  in the F# language as well. Don Syme introduced them in his blog post called 
  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2006/03/24/559582.aspx">F# First Class Events: Simplicity and Compositionality in Imperative Reactive Programming</a>. In this article, I'm going to briefly introduce the implementation
  available in F# and I'll extend it a little bit to allow some more interesting things. In the 
  second article from this series, I'll show how to implement the same thing in C# 3.0 (and in VB 9 too!)</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-dynamic-lookup.aspx/">Dynamic Lookup in F#</a></h1>
    
<p>Many people view <em>dynamic</em> and <em>statically-typed</em> languages as two distinct groups (and 
  this is often a reason for never-ending discussions). In this article, I'll try to show one interesting
  example, which demonstrates that these two groups are not in fact that distinct and that you can implement
  a common <em>dynamic</em> language feature in F#, which is undoubtedly <em>statically-typed</em>.
  The feature that I'm talking about is dynamic invoke using a symbolic representation of the member
  (this is something that can be done using <em>symbols</em> in Ruby, but I'll shortly explain what exactly I mean).</p>  
<p>I intentionally wrote <em>statically-typed</em> and <em>dynamic</em> instead of <em>dynamically-typed</em>.
  In my understanding <em>dynamic</em> is a broader term while <em>dynamically-typed</em> and 
  <em>statically-typed</em> are of course two distinct groups. On the other side <em>dynamic</em> refers
  to language features that are usually available in <em>dynamically-typed</em> languages, just because
  it is easy to support them in a nice way. This doesn't mean that having a <em>dynamic</em> feature in
  a <em>statically-typed</em> language would be impossible - it is just more difficult to implement it in 
  a way that would be similarly elegant.

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-in-fsharp.aspx/">F# Support for ASP.NET and Notes on Samples</a></h1>
    
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I spent three months as an intern in Microsoft Research in Cambridge last year 
  and I was working with Don Syme and James Margetson from the F# team. Most of the time I was working
  on the F# Web Toolkit, which I introduced on the blog some time ago [<a href="#myfsstuff">1</a>],
  but I also worked on a few additions that are now part of the F# release. Probably the most useful addition is 
  a new implementation of the CodeDOM provider for the F# language which makes it possible to use ASP.NET
  smoothly from F# (but it can be used in some other scenarios as well) together with two ASP.NET sample
  applications that you can explore and use as a basis for your web sites. This was actually a part of the
  distribution for a few months now (I of course wanted to write this article much earlier...), so you may 
  have already noticed, but anyway, I'd still like to write down a short description of these ASP.NET samples
  and also a few tips for those who're interested in writing web applications in F#.

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/infinite-cheese.aspx/">Infinite Cheese Fractal using WPF 3D and F#</a></h1>
    
<p>I always liked fractals, because they look like objects from another world, but on the other side
  if you look at some things in our world you can see many similarities with fractals (but not quite as ideal
  with the infinite level of precision). One of my favorite fractals is 3D version of Sierpinski carpet [<a href="#wpffractref">1</a>],
  which itself is based on very famous Cantor set. Quite long time ago I thought that it would be nice to 
  implement animation of flying through this fractal, but I was never good in 3D graphics and it looked like a lot of work,
  so I never get to doing it. Luckily, now with F#, which makes it very easy to write the code to generate the fractal and
  with WPF 3D, which can be easily used to animate the fractal, I finally had everything I needed to do it, so here it is!

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-iv-lang.aspx/">F# Overview (IV.) - Language Oriented Programming</a></h1>
    
<p>In the fourth article of the F# overview series, I will shortly describe how I understad the language oriented paradigm and how the F# language can be used for developing libraries using this paradigm. We will look how discriminated unions relate to this paradigm and at three specific features that support this paradigm, namely <em>active patterns</em>, <em>computation expressions</em> and <em>quotations</em>.</p>

<p>Defining precisely what the term <em>language oriented programming</em> means in context of the F# language would be difficult,
  so I will instead explain a few examples that will demonstrate how I understand it. In general, the goal of language oriented
  programming is to develop a <em>language</em> that would be suitable for some (more specific) class of tasks and use this language 
  for solving these tasks. Of course, developing a real programming language is extremely complex problem, so there are several ways
  for making it easier. As the most elementary example, you can look at XML files (with certain schema) as language that 
  are processed by your program and solve some specific problem (for example configuring the application). As a side note,
  I should mention that I'm not particularly happy with the term ‘language’ in this context, because the term can be used
  for describing a wide range of techniques from very trivial constructs to a complex object-oriented class libraries, 
  but I have not seen any better term for the class of techniques that I’m going to talk about.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-iii-oop.aspx/">F# Overview (III.) - Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming</a></h1>
    
<p>In the third part of the F# Overview article series, we will look at language features that are mostly well known, because they are present in most of the currently used programming languages. Indeed, I'm talking about imperative programming, which is a common way for storing and manipulating application data and about object oriented programming which is used for structuring complex programs.</p>
<p>In general, F# tries to make using them together with the functional constructs described in the <a href="fsharp-ii-functional.aspx">previous part</a> [<a href="fsharp-ii-functional.aspx" target="_blank">^</a>] as natural as possible, which yields several very powerful language constructs.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-ii-functional.aspx/">F# Overview (II.) - Functional Programming</a></h1>
    
<p>In the second part of the F# overview we will look at functional programming, which is probably the most important paradigm used with the F# language, because F# is built on the same grounds as many functional languages. We will first examine the standard F# data types, which are useful to allow the functional programming style and we will also look at a few functional tricks.</p> 

<p>As already mentioned in the <a href="fsharp-i-introduction.aspx">Introduction</a> for this article series,
  F# is a typed functional language, by which I mean that types of all values are determined during the compile-time. 
  However, thanks to the use of a type inference, the types are explicitly specified in the code very rarely as we will see in the 
  following examples. Basic data types (aside from a standard set of primitive numeric and textual types that are present in any 
  .NET language) available in F# are tuple, discriminated union, record, array, list, function and object. In the following 
  quick overview, we will use the F# interactive, which is a tool that compiles and executes the entered text on the fly.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-i-introduction.aspx/">F# Overview (I.) - Introduction</a></h1>
    
<p>In my bachelor thesis I included a short introduction that covered all of the important aspects
  of the F# programming language and I thought that it may be useful to extend it a little bit to cover
  also a topics that were not important for my thesis and post it as an article, so there is one and 
  relatively short article that introduces all the interesting F# features. The article got however a
  bit longer than I expected, so I decided to split it into a three parts that would introduce three
  different <em>paradigms</em> that are supported by F#. Of course, this series won't teach you
  everything about F#, but it tries to cover the main F# design goals and (hopefully) presents
  all the features that make F# interesting and worth learning. In this first part I will shortly introduce 
  F# and the supported paradigms that will be discussed in the upcoming articles.</p>

<p>Some time ago, Granville Barnett (see his <a href="http://gbarnett.org/">homepage and old blog</a> [<a href="http://gbarnett.org/" target="_blank">^</a>]
  or a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gbarnett/">new blog</a> [<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gbarnett/" target="_blank">^</a>]) 
  had a great idea and started a CodePlex project called <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/fsharpsamples">F# Samples</a> [<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/fsharpsamples" target="_blank">^</a>]
  to host various samples written in F# to demonstrate the most important
  concepts of both functional programming and F#. I quite like this idea, so I asked Granville if I could join and add some
  samples that I wrote and today I finally found a time to update what I wanted to upload to the latest version of F# and put it
  online.</p>

<p>In an article about building LINQ queries at runtime in C# 3.0, I described how you can build
  a LINQ query dynamically, for example by combining a set of conditions using the 'or' operator in the
  where clause. I mentioned that the way I implemented it is largely influenced by the F# language, 
  which provides very natural way for manipulations with code like this. In this article I will first 
  shortly introduce FLINQ sample, which is an F# library implementing LINQ support and than I will 
  implement the same examples I presented in the earlier article in F#.</p>

    <p>Traditional "Ajax" application consists of the server-side code and the client-side part written in JavaScript 
  (the more dynamicity you want, the larger JS files you have to write), which exchanges some data with the server-side
  code using XmlHttpRequest, typically in JSON format. I think this approach has 3 main problems, which we
  tried to solve in F# Web Toolkit. There are a few projects that try to solve some of them already - the most interesting 
  projects are Volta from Microsoft [<a href="#fswtintrolinks">1</a>], Links language [<a href="#fswtintrolinks">3</a>] 
  from the University of Edinburgh and Google Web Toolkit [<a href="#fswtintrolinks">2</a>], but none of the projects solve 
  all three problems at once. </p> 
<ol>
<li>Limited client-side environment</li>
<li>Discontinuity between server and client side</li>
<li>Components in web frameworks are only server-side</li>
</ol>
<p>The aim of the F# Web Toolkit is to solve all these three problems...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsparallelops.aspx/">Keep your multi-core CPU busy with F#</a></h1>
    
<p>The growth of computer CPU speed is slowly being replaced by the growth of number of CPUs 
  (or cores) in the computer at least for the close future. This causes a revolution in the way software is 
  written, because traditional and most widely used way of writing concurrent applications using
  threads is difficult and brings several serious issues. Some predictions say that within a few
  years, almost every computer will have about 16 cores, so there is a huge need for programming
  paradigms or idioms that help developers write concurrent software easily (see also <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">The Free Lunch Is Over</a> 
  [<a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm" target="_blank">^</a>] written by Herb Sutter).</p>

<p>Functional programming languages (especially pure functional languages) are interesting from 
  this point of view, because the program doesn't have side-effects which makes it very easy to 
  parallelize it (programs in pure functional languages can't have any side-effects by design, in other functional
  languages like F# the side-effects can be eliminated by following functional programming style). </p>

<p>This article describes the code that makes it possible to parallelize some common F# constructs like the <code>List.map</code> and <code>List.filter</code>...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/quotvis-1.1.13.8.aspx/">Quotations Visualizer for F# 1.1.13.8</a></h1>
    
<p>Quotation Visualizer is my tool that shows visual representation of F# quotations. Stephen noticed (Thanks!) that 
  Quotation Visualizer doesn't compile with the latest version of F# (1.1.13.8), so here is the updated version:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/quotvis-update/quotvis_bin.zip">Download executable</a> (51kB)</li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/quotvis-update/quotvis_src.zip">Download sources</a> (77kB)</li>
</ul>  
<p class="noindent">If you want to know more about this tool, here are links to previous articles about it:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/quotvis.aspx">F# quotations visualizer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/quotvis-reloaded.aspx">F# quotations visualizer - reloaded!</a></li>
</ul>  

<h2>What was wrong?</h2>
<p>This tool is written using F# light syntax, which means that you don't have to write all the semicolons and
  F# compiler uses whitespace to determine end of the blocks (and some other constructs). This compiler option is
  relatively new so it is still evolving. First issue that I had is with class declaration - the following 
  code is not valid with the latest F# version:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
type MyForm = class inherit Form as base
  // ...
end
</pre>  
<p>I used it because it looks more familiar to C# developers :-). Instead of it you have to write the following:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
type MyForm = class 
  inherit Form as base
  // ...
end
</pre>  
<p>The second issue was with the pipeline operator which is useful when working with lists (or other sequences). The 
  correct syntax for using pipeline operator (for expressions that are longer than one line) is following:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
let filteredList = 
       oldArray
    |> Array.to_list 
    |> List.map ( fun m -> /* ... */ ) 
    |> List.filter ( fun m -> /* ... */ ) 
</pre>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-presentation.aspx/">F# presentation at Czech .NET Group meeting</a></h1>
    
<p>On 2nd of November I did a presentation on F# and functional programming at the Czech .NET User Group meeting.
  Because I spent quite a lot of time with puting the presentation together I wanted to make it available to wider 
  audience, so I translated the slides and examples to English (anyway, translating the content took me only a few minutes :-)).
  In case that some of the readers prefer Czech version, I attached the original documents too.</p>
<p>In the presentation I tried to introduce some basic concepts of functional programming (immutable values,
  lazy evaluation) to the audience with no experience with functional programming, as well as present some
  of the most interesting features of F# (like strict type system based on type inference, .NET interoperability and 
  metaprogramming). The whole contents of the presentation is following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Functional programming in F#</strong> - Introduction to the F# type system</li>
  <li><strong>Some useful functional idioms</strong> - How to do Foldl/Map/Filter functions and Lazy evaluation in C#</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive scripting</strong> - What is important for scripting, mathematical simulation</li>
  <li><strong>Interoperability between F# and other .NET languages</strong> - How to use .NET libraries from F# and F# libraries from ohter .NET languages</li>
  <li><strong>F# as a language for ASP.NET</strong> - How to use F# as a language for ASP.NET development</li>
  <li><strong>Meta-programming in F#</strong> - Meta-programming features in F# and the FLINQ project</li>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsclassmeta.aspx/">F# metaprogramming and classes</a></h1>
    
<p>F# quotations allows you to easily write programs that manipulate with data representation
  of program source code. If you're not familiar with quotations I recommend reading my 
  previous article [<a href="#fsclassmeta-links">1</a>] that contains short introduction
  to this topic first. Quotations can be used for example for translating subset of the F# language to 
  another code representation or another language.</p>
  
<p>To get the quotation data of the expression you can either use <code>&lt;@@ .. @@&gt;</code> 
  operator or <code>resolveTopDef</code> function. In the first case the code written
  between the "<code>&lt;@@</code>" and "<code>@@&gt;</code>" is converted to data during the compilation.
  The <code>resolveTopDef</code> function allows you to get quotation data of top-level 
  definition (function) from compiled library at runtime (you have to use <code>--quotation-data</code> 
  command line switch while compiling the library). I mentioned that quotations can be used to represent 
  only subset of the F# language. Currently, one of the quotation limitations is that it's not possible to 
  enclose the whole class in the quotation operators. It is also not possible to get the representation 
  of the whole class at runtime nor the representation of class members (for example methods). </p>
<p>In this article I'll present a simple method that makes it possible to use F# quotations for working with classes as well, however this is rather a prototype that can be used for experimenting and discovering areas where working with classes might be useful, not a fully working solution.</p>

</div>

<p>Some time ago, I wrote an article about useful utility called <a href="http://www.tomasp.net/blog/quotvis.aspx">F# quotations visualizer</a>.
  This utility can be used to show visual representation of F# quotations, that can represent (subset of) source code written in F#.
  There are two ways that you can use to get F# quotations - first is using operators <code>&lt;@@@@ ... @@@@&gt;</code> (this
  returns quotation of the code written inside the operator), second method is to get quotation of top level definition from compiled 
  F# assembly (you have to explicitly enable this using command line switch <code>--enable-quotation-data</code> while compiling assembly).
</p>
<p>Because I added several new features to the original Quotations visualizer, I decided to publish the latest version - here is the list of main improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rewritten using active patterns (new F# language feature)</li>
  <li>It is possible to extract quotations from compiled F# assembly (if it contains quotation data)</li>
  <li>Added support for several missing language constructs</li>
</ul>

<p>
BTW: CodePlex looks like a really good site. It is based on Visual Studio Team System (which means that developers of the project can do most of the work directly from Visual Studio). It provides management of "Work Items" (TODO list), source control and many other useful things! For example if you have any feature requests or bug requests, send them to the discussion and I can easilly create work item from the message in the discussions.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in this project and you want to help with developing of some parts, or if you are working on a project that is related to CodeDOM and F#, please let me know. Any help or feedback is kindly welcome!

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-fsharp-intro.aspx/">ASP.NET web applications in F#</a></h1>
    
<p>CodeDOM (Code Document Object Model) is set of objects (located in <code>System.CodeDom</code> namespace) that can be used
    for representing logical structure of .NET source code. These classes are used for generating Web service references
    (using <code>wsdl.exe</code> tool), for generating typed datasets and in many other situations. The most interesting
    use of CodeDOM classes is in ASP.NET where ASP.NET generates code from <code>aspx</code>/<code>ascx</code> files and 
    compiles this code into web site assemblies (together with the code written in code behind files).</p>

  <p>This means, that you can use any language for developing ASP.NET web sites, as long as you implement CodeDOM provider
    that generates source code from CodeDOM structure and can compile these source files (this can be simply done by executing 
    command line compiler). 
I was recently working on CodeProvider for the F# language, and finally it supports everything
    what is needed by ASP.NET (however it is complete and it doesn't work for example with <code>wsdl.exe</code>). Using this
    CodeDOM provider you can write ENTIRE web site in F# (including in-line code enclosed in &lt;% ... source code ... %&gt;).
    I also created project template for F# web site that can be imported to Visual Studio 2005, so you can easilly try 
    writing web pages in F#...</p>

<p>I already <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsquotations.aspx">explained</a> what F# quotations are
  and I explained how you can do some simple manipulations with it. In this article I'd like to 
  present an application that I wrote and that can be helpful when working with quotations. 
  It displays clear graphical representation of given F# quotation (using Windows Forms TreeView control).

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-slides-and-demos.aspx/">Slides and demos from F# presentation</a></h1>
    
<p>This semester I attended Advanced .NET Seminar that was led by <a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/">Tomas Matousek</a> [<a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/" target="_blank">^</a>] who is one of the authors of <a href="http://www.php-compiler.net">Phalanger project</a> [<a href="http://www.php-compiler.net" target="_blank">^</a>] (Which is an amazing project by the way. It takes PHP source code and compiles it without any modification to .NET).
Seminar was mostly focused on Rotor and .NET internals, so if you want to learn more about these topics you can look at <a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/Teaching/CLR.htm">Advanced .NET programming</a> [<a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/Teaching/CLR.htm" target="_blank">^</a>] slides (by Tomas Matousek).</p>
<p>I did one presentation at this seminar too. It was about the F# language developed at Microsoft Research. It was just a quick overview of F# features, because F# is very rich topic, so it coveres only the language (functional vs. imperative behavior), F# type system, compilation of F# constructs to .NET and interoperability with .NET (for example how to create windows forms application in F#). At the end, I also mentioned F# meta-programming that allows you to look at F# code as data.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsquotations.aspx/">F# - Simple quotations transformation</a></h1>
    
<p>This article describes very simple code that I wrote while learning
  how to work with the F# quotations library. Using the F# quotations you 
  can get tree representation of the quoted expression. This allows you
  to write code that takes code written in F# as data and performs some
  code analysis or compiles/translates that code to different language.
  This is very similar to the new C# 3.0 expression trees where you can 
  get expression tree from lambda expression and translate this tree 
  for example to SQL (using DLINQ). However expression trees in C# 3.0 
  are very limited when compared with F# quotations, so that's one of 
  the many reasons why F# is interesting language.</p>
