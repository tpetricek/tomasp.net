    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/popup-from-hell/">Pop-up from Hell: On the growing opacity of web programs</a></h1>
    <p>I started to learn how to program in high school at the end of the 1990s using a mix of BASIC, Turbo
Pascal and HTML with JavaScript. The seed for this blog post comes from my experience with learning
how to program in JavaScript, without having much guidance or organized resources. This article continues
a theme that I started in my <a href="http://tomasp.net/commodore64">interactive Commodore 64 article</a>,
which is to look at past programming systems and see what interesting past ideas have been lost
in contemporary systems. Unlike with Commodore 64, which I first used in 2018 in the
Seattle Living Computers museum, my perspective on the Early Web may be biased by personal
experience. I will do my best to not make this post sound like a grumbling of an old nerd!
(I thought this only comes later, but I may have been wrong...)</p>
<div class="rdecor"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/popup-from-hell/close-me.gif" style="max-width:400px" /></div>
<p>The 1990s, the web had a fair amount of quirky web pages, often created just for fun. The GeoCities
hosting service, which has <a href="http://www.oocities.org">partly been archived</a> is a witness of this
and there are even academic books, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/2YiEUVe">Dot-Com Design</a> documenting
this history.</p>
<p>Some of the quirky things that you could do with JavaScript included creating roll-over effects
(making an image change when mouse pointer is over it), creating an animation that follows the
cursor as it moves and, of course, annoying the users with all sorts of pop-up windows for both
entertaining and advertising purposes. Annoying pop-ups will be the starting point for my blog
post, but I'll be using those to make a more general and interesting point about how programs
evolve to become more opaque.</p>
<p><em>This blog post is based on a talk <a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/Talks/2021/popup-from-hell/">Popup from hell: Reflections on the most annoying 1990s
program</a> that I did recently at an
(in person!) meeting of the <a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/">PROGRAMme project</a>. Thanks to
everyone who attended for lively discussion and useful feedback!</em></p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fsharp-events/">Upcoming F# events - learn Suave, FsLab &amp; more!</a></h1>
    <p>Some people in the F# community have reputation for traveling too much. I do not know how that is
possible, but as it happens, I will be visiting a couple of places in June and doing a number of
talks, workshops and courses. So, if you are thinking about getting into F#, web development with
F# using the <a href="http://suave.io">amazing Suave library</a>, playing with the new trendy F# to JavaScript
compiler <a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable">called Fable</a>, or learning about the recent
features in <a href="https://twitter.com/fslaborg/status/728397249697488896">FsLab and Ionide</a>, then
continue reading!</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fsharp-events/map.png" style="margin:0px 5% 20px 5%; width:90%" />
<p>The map includes all my travels, but not all of the pins are for F# events. I'm visiting Prague
just to see my family (even though there is a <a href="http://www.fsharping.cz">new awesome F# meetup there</a>)
and my stop in Paris is attending <a href="http://www.hapoc.org/hapop3">Symposium for the History and Philosophy of
Programming</a> (although we might still do something with the local F#
group too).</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/reading-list/">Philosophy of science books every computer scientist should read</a></h1>
    <p>When I tell my fellow computer scientists or software developers that I'm interested in
<em>philosophy of science</em>, they first look a bit confused, then we have a really interesting
discussion about it and then they ask me for some interesting books they could read about it.
Given that Christmas is just around the corner and some of the readers might still be looking
for a good present to get, I thought that now is the perfect time to turn my answer into a
blog post!</p>
<p>So, what is philosophy of science about? In summary, it is about trying to better understand
science. I'll keep using the word <em>science</em> here, but I think <em>engineering</em> would work equally
well. As someone who recently spent a couple of years doing a PhD on programming language theory,
I find this extremely important for computer science (and programming). How can we make better
programming languages if we do not know what <em>better</em> means? And what do we mean when we talk
about very basic concepts like <em>types</em> or programming <em>errors</em>?</p>
<p>Reading about philosophy of science inspired me to write a couple of essays on some of the
topics above including <a href="/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/">What can programming language research learn from the philosophy of science?</a> and two essays that discuss the <a href="/blog/2015/against-types/">nature of types in programming languages</a> and also
the nature of <a href="/blog/2015/failures/">errors and miscomputations</a>. This blog post lists some of
the interesting books that I've read and that influenced my thinking (not just) when writing the
aforementioned essays.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/fsharp-ml-mvp/">F# + ML |&gt; MVP Summit: Talk recordings, slides and source code</a></h1>

<p>I was fortunate enough to make it to the Microsoft MVP summit this year. I didn't learn anything
secret (and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you!) but one thing I did learn is that there is a lot
of interest in data science and machine learning both inside Microsoft and in the MVP community.
What was less expected and more exciting was that there was also a lot of interest in F#, which
is a perfect fit for both of these topics!</p>
<p>When I visited Microsoft back in May to talk about <a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/Talks/2015/scalable-ml-ds-fsharp/redmond/">Scalable Machine Learning and Data Science
with F#</a> at an internal event,
I ended up chatting with the organizer about F# and we agreed that it would be nice to do more
on F#, which is how we ended up organizing the <a href="http://fsharpworks.com/mvp-summit/2015.html">F# + ML |&gt; MVP Summit 2015</a>
mini-conference on the Friday after the summit.</p>

<p>Since I <a href="https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek/status/544531884030840832">submitted my PhD thesis in December</a>,
I had a little bit of time to finish some of the things that I wanted to do for a really long time, but
never quite found time to actually do them. This included <a href="http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/mac-and-linux.html">getting the R provider to work on
Mac</a> and also creating a new
web site for my various functional programming trainings and books. I even have a nice domain name:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.functional-programming.net">www.functional-programming.net</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The page also discusses a couple of business reasons for looking into functional programming. So, if you're
a business person wondering why you should send your developers on an F# course, the site has the answers
for you too! (Or if you are developer and need a page for your boss.) The other place to check out is the
official <a href="http://www.fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation web page</a> is another great resource and the
<a href="http://fsharp.org/testimonials/">testimonials hosted there</a>.</p>
<p>The page has some information about the <a href="http://functional-programming.net/#trainings">various trainings we're offering at fsharpWorks</a>
and about the two F# books I co-authored (<a href="http://functional-programming.net/rwfp/">Real-World Functional Programming</a> and
brand new <a href="http://functional-programming.net/deepdives/">F# Deep Dives</a>).
I'm happy that we can offer some special deals on both the books and the F# FastTrack course in London,
so if you're considering getting into F#, now is a good time!</p>

<p>I guess that it might be a bit too late for adding to your list of new year's resulution now.
But just if you still have an empty slot (or in case an originally taken slot has become
available), your new year's resolution should be to get involved with F#!</p>
<p>Obviously, the goal of this blog post is to sell you some of my F# trainings and other materials -
including the online course on <a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html">F# in Finance</a> and our
<a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/fast-track.html">FastTrack to F#</a> course in London and New York
and also the <a href="http://manning.com/petricek2">F# Deep Dives</a> book. But to conceal this fact, I'm
going to fill most of the blog post with useful information about F#, the F# Software Foundation
and the F# community (but if you really just want to read about my courses, scroll down to the
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/why-fsharp-in-2015/index.html#courses">second section</a>).</p>

<p>Exactly two weeks ago, I started a three month internship at BlueMountain Capital in New York.
They have a <a href="http://techblog.bluemountaincapital.com/">technical blog</a> and should be well known to the
F# community thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/BlueMountainCapital/FSharpRProvider">R type provider</a>
which was written by Howard Mansell (<a href="https://twitter.com/hmansell">@hmansell</a>).
I'll have the pleasure of working with Howard on some more open source data-science related tools for F#
(and C#). I'll write more about these when we have something to share, but if you want to
contribute and help us, join the Data and Machine Learning <a href="http://fsharp.org/technical-groups/">working group at F# Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from my work, I'm also happy to get involved with the great F# community in New York!
We already have some events planned - <strong>Progressive F# Tutorials</strong> and <strong>FastTrack to F#</strong> are
scheduled for September 16.-19. so you can become an F# guru in 4 days :-). But I'm also happy
to have a chat with anyone interested in F# and perhaps do a lunch time talk, if you need to
convince your colleagues or boss that F# is a good choice.</p>

<p>After a few years, I finally managed to find the time to attend the 
  <a href="http://www.2013mvpsummit.com/">MVP Summit</a> this year. The Summit is
  an annual event where people who are active in Microsoft technical communities come
  to the Microsoft headquarters to learn about new things (and, of course, tell them 
  how they should be doing their job :-)). The Summit is a great place to meet interesting
  people (so if you're reading this and will be there, definitely get in touch!)
</p>

<p>The good news - for those interested in F# - is that I'll be doing two F# talks 
  on the way. I'll stop in <strong>Boston</strong> on <strong>February 13</strong> and then in <strong>New York</strong> on <strong>February 25</strong>.
  I'll be talking about different topics (Google tells me that the distance is 
  <em>only</em> 216 miles!)
