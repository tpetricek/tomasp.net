    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-join-calculus.aspx/">TryJoinads (IV.) - Concurrency using join calculus</a></h1>
    
<p>Join calculus provides a declarative way of expressing asynchronous synchronization
patterns. It has been use as a basis for programming languages (JoCaml and COmega), but also
as a basis for libraries (embedded in C# and Scala). Using joinads, it is possible to 
embed join calculus in F# with a nice syntax using the <code>match!</code> construct. Formally,
join calculus does not form a <em>monad</em>, but it can be viewed as a version of <em>joinad</em>
as described in the <a href="../pubs.html">first paper on joinads</a>.</p>

<p>The programming model is based on <em>channels</em> and <em>join patterns</em>. A channel can be viewed
as a thread-safe mailbox into which we can put values without blocking the caller. In some
sense, this is quite similar to <a href="agents.html">F# agents</a>. A join pattern is then a rule
saying that a certain combination of values in channels should trigger a specific reaction
(and remove values from the channels). The ability to match on multiple channels distinguishes
join calculus from F# agents.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-agents.aspx/">TryJoinads (III.): Agent-based programming</a></h1>
    
<p>Another area where the <code>match!</code> syntax can be used is when programming with F# <em>agents</em>,
implemented by the <code>MailboxProcessor</code> type. Formally, agents do not form the monad
structure in a useful way - when programming with agents, we do not compose a new agents,
but instead we write code that (imperatively) receives messages from the agent's mailbox
and handles them.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates an <code>agent { ... }</code> computation builder that can be used for 
implementing the body of an agent. Normally, the body of an agent is an <em>asynchronous
workflow</em>. The code in the body uses <code>let!</code> to perform asynchronous operations, most 
importantly to call <code>inbox.Receive</code> to get the next message from the inbox. When the
agent intends to handle only certain kinds of messages, it can use <code>inbox.Scan</code>. When
using the <code>agent</code> builder, pattern matching on messages can be written using <code>match!</code> and
it is possible to write code that ignores certain types of messages simply by writing an
incomplete pattern matching.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinad-tasks.aspx/">TryJoinads (II.): Task-based parallelism</a></h1>
    
<p>The implementation of joinad operations for the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type is quite similar to the 
implementation of <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code>, because the two types have similar properties. They both
produce at most one value (or an exception) and they both take some time to complete.</p>

<p>Just like for asynchronous workflows, pattern matching on multiple computations using 
<code>match!</code> gives us a parallel composition (with the two tasks running in parallel) and
choice between clauses is non-deterministic, depending on which clause completes first.</p>

<p>Unlike asynchronous workflows, the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type does not require any support for
aliasing. A value of type <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> represents a <em>running</em> computation that can be
accessed from multiple parts of program. In this sense, the type <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code> is more
similar to a function <code>unit -&gt; Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> than to the type <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> itself.</p>

<p>The key difference between tasks and asynchronous workflows is that the latter provides
better support for writing non-blocking computations that involve <em>asynchronous</em> 
long-running operations such as I/O or waiting for a certain event. Tasks are more
suitable for high-performance CPU-intensive computations.</p>

<p>If you have been following my blog, you've probably already heard of <em>joinads</em>. It is
a research extension of F# computation expressions (or monads in Haskell). The extension
makes computation expressions more useful in domains like parallel, concurrent and reactive
programming. However, it can be used for any type of computation including, for example, parsers.
If you're interested in detailed description, you can find it in two academic papers that
I blogged about previously: <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">PADL 2011</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/docase-haskell.aspx">Haskell 2011</a>.</p>

<p>The extension adds a keyword <code>match!</code> - as the syntax suggests, it is akin to pattern
matching using <code>match</code>, but instead of pattern matching on values, you can pattern match
on computations like <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code> (or on other monadic values). Just like other features of
computation expressions, the <code>match!</code> syntax is translated to applications of several
methods defined by the computation builder.</p>

<p>I won't say more about joinads in this post, because you can now easily try joinads yourself...</p>

<p>More than a year ago, Mike Stephens from <a href="http://manning.com">Manning</a> (who
 was also behind my <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>
 book) asked me if I'd be interested in collaborating on a project for MSDN. The idea 
 was to collaborate with Microsoft on creating some additional content for the official
 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd233154(VS.100).aspx">F# Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the new content appeared on MSDN, so I finally have an excuse for the
  recent lack of blogging! Although the content contains a large number of new articles
  that are not based on my book, you can find it in the MSDN section named after my
  book, right under <em>Visual F#</em>. If you can't wait to check it out, here are all the links:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/docase-haskell.aspx/">Extending Monads with Pattern Matching (Haskell 2011)</a></h1>
    
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">paper about <em>joinads</em></a> and the <code>match!</code> extension
  of the F# language. The paper was quite practically oriented and didn't go into much details about 
  the theory behind <em>joinads</em>. Many of the examples from the F# version relied on some
  imperative features of F#. I believe that this is useful for parctical programming, but I 
  also wanted to show that the same idea can work in the <em>purely functional</em> context.</p>

<p>To show that joinads work in the pure setting, I created a Haskell version of the idea.
  The implementation (available below) is quite simple and consists of a pre-processor for 
  Haskell source files and numerous examples. However, more important part of the recent work of 
  joinads is a more detailed theoretical background.</p>

<p>The theory of joinads, together with the language design of Haskell extension that implements
  it is discussed in a paper <em>Extending Monads with Pattern Matching</em>, which was accepted
  for publication at the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2011/index.html">Haskell 
  Symposium 2011</a>. Here is the abstract of the paper:</p>

      <p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
      Sequencing of effectful computations can be neatly captured using monads and elegantly written using 
      <code>do</code> notation. In practice such monads often allow additional ways of composing computations, 
      which have to be written explicitly using combinators.
      </p><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
      We identify joinads, an abstract notion of computation that is stronger than monads and captures
      many such ad-hoc extensions. In particular, joinads are monads with three additional operations: 
      one of type <code>m a -> m b -> m (a, b)</code> captures various forms of <em>parallel composition</em>, 
      one of type <code>m a -> m a -> m a</code> that is inspired by <em>choice</em> and one of type <code>m a -> m (m a)</code> 
      that captures <em>aliasing</em> of computations. Algebraically, the first two operations form a 
      near-semiring with commutative multiplication.
      </p><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
      We introduce <code>docase</code> notation that can be viewed as a monadic version of <code>case</code>. Joinad laws
      make it possible to prove various syntactic equivalences of programs written using <code>docase</code> 
      that are analogous to equivalences about <code>case</code>. Examples of joinads that benefit from the notation
      include speculative parallelism, waiting for a combination of user interface events, but also 
      encoding of validation rules using the intersection of parsers.
      </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/comprefun.aspx/">Fun with parallel monad comprehensions (The Monad.Reader)</a></h1>
    
<p style="font-style:italic;">
This article is a re-publication of an article that I wrote some time ago for 
<a href="http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/">The Monad.Reader</a> magazine, which is an
online magazine about functional programming and Haskell. You can also
read the article in the original PDF format as part of the <a href="http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/issue18.pdf">Issue 18</a>
(together with two other interesting articles). The samples from the article can be found <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.Joinads">on Github</a>.
</p>

<p>Monad comprehensions have an interesting history. They were the first syntactic extension for 
programming with monads. They were implemented in Haskell, but later replaced with plain list
comprehensions and monadic <code>do</code> notation. Now, monad comprehensions are back in Haskell,
more powerful than ever before!</p>

<p>Redesigned monad comprehensions generalize the syntax for working with lists. Quite interestingly, 
they also generalize syntax for zipping, grouping and ordering of lists. This article shows how to 
use some of the new expressive power when working with well-known monads. You'll learn what 
"parallel composition" means for parsers, a poor man's concurrency monad and an evaluation 
order monad.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/speculative-par-monad.aspx/">Explicit speculative parallelism for Haskell's Par monad</a></h1>
    
<p>Haskell provides quite a few ways for writing parallel programs, but none of them is fully automatic.
  The programmer has to use some annotations or library to run computations in parallel <em>explicitly</em>. 
  The most recent paper (and library) for writing parallel programs follows the latter approach. You can find more
  information about the library in a paper by Simon Marlow et al. <a type="external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/parallel/monad-par.pdf">A
  monad for deterministic parallelism</a> and it is also available on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-par" type="external">Hackage</a>.
  However, I'll explain all the important bits that I'll use in this article.</p>

<p>The library provides an explicit way for writing parallel programs using a <code>Par</code> monad. The library contains 
  constructs for spawning computations and sharing state using blocking variables. However, the whole programming model
  is fully deterministic. I believe that it is sometimes useful to lift the determinacy requirement.
  Some programs are deterministic, but the fact cannot be (easily) automatically verified. For example, say you have two functions
  <code>fib1</code> and <code>fib2</code>. They both give the same result, but each of them is more efficient
  than the other one on certain inputs. To calculate a Fibonacci number, the program could <em>speculatively</em> 
  try to evaluate both functions in parallel and return the result of the one that finishes first.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this cannot be safely implemented using a fully deterministic library. In this article, I'll show some
  examples where speculative parallelism can be useful and I'll talk about an extension to the <code>Par</code> monad
  that I implemented (available on <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.ParMonad">GitHub</a>). The extension allows 
  programmers to write <em>speculative computations</em>, provided that they manually verify that their code is 
  deterministic. </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-adash-cancellation.aspx/">F# Parallel Extras (III.): Financial dashboard with cancellation</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article we'll look at several improvements that can be done to the Financial dashboard example
  (originally from the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a> book).
  When I was translating samples in the book from C# to F#, the sample struck me, because it looks like
  a perfect fit for F# asynchronous workflows (instead of the <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> type used in the
  C# version). I already talked about an <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-adash.aspx">alternative 
  implementation</a> based on asynchronous workflows. However that version was still following some of the
  programming patterns, from the original C# version, which are not idiomatic in F#. In this article, I'll talk
  about a few other improvements that we can make to the sample...</p>

<p>In the original version of the sample (in both C# and F#), we explicitly checked whether a cancellation
  token has been cancelled in every single operation. This was needed in C#, because tasks do not support
  cancellation automatically. However, F# asynchronous workflows make cancellation easier. They automatically
  check if the computation should be cancelled at the beginning and the end of every asynchronous call. Our
  first change will be to use this feature. Also, the original version propagates a <code>null</code> value
  when the computation is cancelling. In F# we don't need that and we'll only change the type of the overall
  result to <code>option&lt;T&gt;</code>, so that we can notify the user interface (but we don't need to 
  propagate cancellation explicitly). Finally, the original version contained sequential implementation, but
  didn't provide any way of actually running it, so we'll do a bit of refactoring to make that sample 
  actually useable.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-blockingagent.aspx/">F# Parallel Extras (II.): Agent-based blocking queue</a></h1>
    
<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-image-pipeline.aspx">previous article</a>, we 
  briefly introduced the <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> type and we used it to implement the
  pipeline pattern (from Chapter 7 of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>)
  using asynchronous workflows. The type was used to represent intermediate buffers with a limited size.
  In this article we'll take a look at the implementation of the type. The type implements a very useful
  pattern in agent-based parallel programming, so you can use it in your work, but it could be also 
  interesting as a demonstration of the F# <code>Agent&lt;T&gt;</code> type (an recommended alias 
  for the <code>MailboxProcessor&lt;T&gt;</code> type).</p>
<p>The <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> type is similar to <code>BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> 
  from .NET 4.0. It has methods for adding and removing elements that block when the operation cannot be
  done (e.g. adding when the queue is full or removing when the queue is empty). The most important 
  difference is that it can be used <em>asynchronously</em>. This means that when we call its operations
  form F# asynchronous workflow (using <code>let!</code> and <code>do!</code>), the operation will block
  the calling workflow, but it will not block any physical thread. We start by looking at the overall
  structure of the agent and then look at the body of the agent which implements its behavior (using
  a state machine)...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-image-pipeline.aspx/">F# Parallel Extras (I.): Image pipeline using agents</a></h1>
    
<p>In a <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-samples.aspx">recent blog post series</a>,
  I wrote about parallel programming samples that accompany the 
  <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>
  book by patterns &amp; practices group at Microsoft. The F# translation of the samples that I
  wrote about mostly followed the style used in the book, so it used patterns that 
  are typical for C#. However, some of the samples can be written in F# in a more interesting way...</p>
<p>In this article, we'll take a look at agent-based implementation of the Image pipeline 
  example (from chapter 7). A <em>pipeline</em> is a useful pattern if you need to process large
  number of inputs in parallel and the processing consists of multiple phases or steps. In the
  original implementation, the pipeline was implemented using <code>BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>
  and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> types from .NET 4.0.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll show a 
  version that uses F# agents and asynchronous workflows. We'll use a <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> 
  type, which is <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-blockingagent.aspx">discussed in another 
  article</a>. It represents a queue with limited capacity that asynchronously blocks the process that is adding 
  values if there is no space in the buffer and blocks the process that reads values when there are no 
  values. This type can be elegantly used to implement the pipeline pattern. In this article, we'll 
  demonstrate it by writing a four-phase pipeline that processes images. As you'll see, 
  the agent-based version of the code is very much easier to write and has similar performance as 
  the original version.</p>

<p>In the fourth part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll take a look at the Adatum Financial 
  Dashboard sample. The sample is a part of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>, which is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide, but the F# translation
  contains several additional interesting aspects that I'll introduce in this article.</p>

<p>The sample simulates a financial modelling application that performs processing of market
  data in several steps that can be partly executed in parallel. In this article we'll compare two
  implementations. The first one (similar to the C# version) uses the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type 
  from .NET 4.0 and chains steps using the <code>ContinueWith</code> method. The second version is 
  F# specific and it implements step as a sequential computation wrapped in asynchronous 
  workflows. Partial results are reported to the user interface using events.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-aggregate.aspx/">Parallel Programming in F# (III.): Aggregating data</a></h1>
    
<p>In this part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll explore examples of parallel aggregation 
  from Chapter 4 of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>, which is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide. In this article,
  we'll look at the F# translation and in particular at several functions from the <code>PSeq</code>
  module. Some of the functionality is currently available only in the "PSeq.fs" distributed with the
  samples, but will eventually appear in F# PowerPack as well. </p>

<p>Aggregation of data in parallel is an interesting problem. As we've seen in the previous article, 
  PLINQ and tasks make it easy to parallelize independent blocks of code that don't share any state.
  Unfortunatelly, not all programs are like that. In particular, we often need to aggregate all
  elements of a sequence - when writing sequential code in F#, you would use the <code>Seq.fold</code>
  function. In this article, we'll look at functions that implement fold parallel.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll discuss some of the F# examples and we'll look at a couple of aspects that
  are specific for F#. In particular, we'll look at working with Parallel LINQ (both directly and using
  <code>PSeq</code> module from F# PowerPack) and working with tasks. We'll also look at an interesting 
  example (using closures) where C# version doesn't behave as expected, but a literal translation in F# corrects the 
  problem.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-samples.aspx/">Parallel Programming in F# (I.): Introducing the samples</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-parallel-samples/book.png" style="float:right;margin:20px;"/>
<p><a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a> is a 
  guide written by the patterns &amp; practices group at Microsoft. It introduces .NET programmers to
  patterns for including parallelism in their applications (using support for parallel programming in
  .NET 4.0). It introduces techniques such as parallel loops, parallel tasks, data aggregation and so on.
  The book includes numerous samples in C# and Visual Basic that can be easily copied and adapted 
  to match your needs.</p>

<p>As part of a contracting work for the F# team, I developed an F# version of the samples, which is 
  now available on the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">book web site</a>.
  You can get it by downloading <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/releases/view/50473">F# code samples</a> (ZIP) from the 1.0 release, or you can download the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets" 
  type="external">latest version of the source code</a> directly. The F# version of the
  code is mostly a direct translation of the C# versions, but there are a few interesting places that
  are worth discussing. In particular, some of the samples use the <code>PSeq</code> module from F#
  PowerPack and I also added a version of one example that uses F# asynchronous workflows.</p>

<p>In this article series, I'll look at several interesting examples from the F# version of the source code.
  We'll look how to use PLINQ and Tasks (which are available in .NET 4.0) from F# (Part II.) including some advanced topics such 
  as the Map-Reduce algorithm (Part III.). We'll also look at a larger example built using tasks and an alternative 
  implementation using asynchronous workflows (Part IV.) Here are links to the individual articles:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/custom-linq-grouping.aspx/">Using custom grouping operators in LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>You can use LINQ to write queries that perform grouping of data using <code>group by</code>
  or ordering of data using <code>orderby</code> clause. LINQ provides the default
  (and the most common) implementation of both of the operations, but sometimes you 
  may need a slightly different behavior when grouping or ordering data (this article
  is motivated by a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2194761/can-i-use-linq-to-retrieve-only-on-change-values" type="external">question on StackOverflow</a>
  which needs to do exactly that for grouping).</p>
  
<p>Let's look at a simple example, which shows when we may need a different behavior when 
  grouping data. For example, we may have the following list of stock trades
  containing a name of a stock and the price of the trade (stored for example as a list
  of <code>TradeInfo</code> classes with properties <code>Name</code> and <code>Price</code>):</p>  
<pre lang="csharp">
{ { Name = "MSFT", Price = 80.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 70.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 100.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 200.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 300.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 30.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 20.00 } }</pre>  
<p>Now, we may want to group adjacent trades into a single summary record which will contain
  the name of the stock (which is same for all trades in each group), the number of trades 
  in the group and an average price in the group. The desired results are:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
{ { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 75.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Count = 3, AvgPrice = 200.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 25.00 } }</pre>  
<p>The operation that we want to do is very similar to <code>group by</code> in LINQ, but 
  it doesn't do quite the same thing! If we used <code>group by</code>, we would get only 
  two groups as the result. However, as I wrote earlier, we want to group only 
  <em>adjacent trades</em>. You could write your own extension method to do this,
  but then you need to leave the elegant LINQ query syntax. In this article, I'll show
  you how to get the desired results using a simple LINQ query with a <code>group by</code>
  clause...</p>

<p>I already <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/book-source-available.aspx">mentioned</a> that I was doing my second internship
  with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" type="external">Don Syme</a> at Microsoft Research in Cambridge.
  This time, I was in Cambridge for 6 months from October until April, so it has been more than a month since 
  I left, but as you can guess I didn't have time to write anything about the internship until now... There isn't
  much to say though, because the internship was simply fantastic. Cambridge is a beautiful place (here are
  some <a href="http://cid-6ddff5260c96e30a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2008%20Autumn%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">autumn</a> and <a href="http://cid-6ddff5260c96e30a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2009%20Winter%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">winter</a> photos),
  the Microsoft Research lab in Cambridge is full of smart people, so it is a perferct working environment
  (except that you realize that you're not as clever as you think :-)). Also, it is just a few meters away from the
  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk" type="external">Computer Laboratory</a> of the Cambridge University, so there are always many 
  interesting talks and seminars. So, big thanks to Don Syme, James Margetson and everyone else who I had a chance 
  to work with during the internship.</p>
  
<p>One of the reasons why I didn't have much time to write about the internship earlier is that I
  was invited to the <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/" type="external">Lang.NET Symposium</a> shortly
  after the end of the internship. I had a chance to talk about my project there as well and there is
  even a video recording from the talk (the link is below), so you can watch it to find out more about my recent F# work.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-overview.aspx/">Functional Programming in .NET using C# and F# (Manning Greenpaper)</a></h1>
    
<p>
  Functional programming languages have been around for a while and were always astonishing for their 
  ability to express the ideas in a succinct, declarative way allowing the developer to focus on the 
  essence of problem rather than on technical details of the solution. Recently, functional paradigm is 
  gaining new prominence as an efficient way to handle development of multi-processor, parallel and 
  asynchronous applications.</p>

<p>
  Functional ideas are arising in C# as well as in other main-stream languages and functional languages 
  are becoming an alternative for real-world projects.  Also, Microsoft recently introduced a new 
  language called F#, which has a strong background in traditional functional languages, but as a .NET 
  language also benefits from the rich .NET and Visual Studio ecosystem.</p>

  Thanks to my editors at <a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external">Manning</a> I have the permission
  to publish it on my blog. We’ll look at several aspects of functional programming and how the same 
  concepts, which are essential for the functional paradigm, look in the F# and in C# 3.0 with LINQ. We 
  will shortly look at the basic programming language features like lambda functions and type inference 
  that are now available in both F# and C#. Functional programming isn’t only about language features, 
  but also about using different programming style, so we’ll look at some high level concepts as well. 
  These include using immutable data structures for developing code that can be executed in parallel 
  and writing code in a more declarative style.</p>

<p>
  Thanks to the combination of C# 3.0 and F#, this article shows the ideas in a way that should be 
  familiar to you in C#, but also shows a further step that you can take with a primarilly functional
  language F#. If you're a .NET developer and you want to understand what functional programming is
  and how it can help you to become better and more productive then continue reading. If you'll find 
  this article interesting, then don't forget to check out the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">book</a>,
  which explains everything in larger detail and discusses many other interesting ideas.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-programming-book.aspx/">Announcing: Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a></h1>
    
<p>If you’ve been reading my blog or seen some my articles, you know that I’m a big fan of the F# language and functional programming style. I’m also often trying to present a bit different view of C# and LINQ – for me it is interesting mainly because it brings many functional features to a main-stream language and allows using of many of the functional patterns in a real-world. Elegant way for working with data, which is the most commonly used feature of C# 3.0, is just one example of this functional approach. Talking about real-world applications of functional programming, there is also fantastic news about F#. It was announced last year that F# will become fully supported Visual Studio language and the first CTP version of F# was released this week!</p>

<p>I always thought that the topics mentioned in the previous paragraph are really interesting and that functional programming will continue to become more and more important. That’s why I’m really excited by the news that I’d like to announce today – I’m writing a book about functional programming in F# and C#....</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/infinite-cheese.aspx/">Infinite Cheese Fractal using WPF 3D and F#</a></h1>
    
<p>I always liked fractals, because they look like objects from another world, but on the other side
  if you look at some things in our world you can see many similarities with fractals (but not quite as ideal
  with the infinite level of precision). One of my favorite fractals is 3D version of Sierpinski carpet [<a href="#wpffractref">1</a>],
  which itself is based on very famous Cantor set. Quite long time ago I thought that it would be nice to 
  implement animation of flying through this fractal, but I was never good in 3D graphics and it looked like a lot of work,
  so I never get to doing it. Luckily, now with F#, which makes it very easy to write the code to generate the fractal and
  with WPF 3D, which can be easily used to animate the fractal, I finally had everything I needed to do it, so here it is!

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx/">Asynchronous Programming in C# using Iterators</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article we will look how to write programs that perform asynchronous operations without 
  the typical inversion of control. To briefly introduce what I mean by 'asynchronous' and 
  'inversion of control' - asynchronous refers to programs that perform some long running operations 
  that don't necessary block a calling thread, for example accessing the network, calling web services 
  or performing any other I/O operation in general. The inversion of control refers to the code structure 
  that you have to use when writing a code that explicitly passes a C# delegate as a callback to the
  asynchronous method (typically called <code>Begin<em>Something</em></code> in .NET). The asynchronous method
  calls the delegate when the operation completes, which reverses the way you write the code - instead of
  encoding the control flow using typical language constructs (e.g. <code>while</code> loop) you have to 
  use global variables and write your own control mechanism.</p>
<p>The funny thing about this article is that it could have been written at least 3 years ago when
  a beta version of Visual Studio 2005 and C# 2.0 became first available, but it is using iterators in 
  a slightly bizarre way, so it is not easy to realize that this is possible. Actually, I will use some C# 3.0
  methods in the article as well, but only extension methods and mainly just to keep the code nicer. As with 
  my earlier article about building LINQ queries at runtime, I realized that it can be done in C# when I was playing with 
  the F# solution (called F# Asynchronous Workflows), where this approach is very natural, so I will shortly
  mention the F# implementation as well.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsparallelops.aspx/">Keep your multi-core CPU busy with F#</a></h1>
    
<p>The growth of computer CPU speed is slowly being replaced by the growth of number of CPUs 
  (or cores) in the computer at least for the close future. This causes a revolution in the way software is 
  written, because traditional and most widely used way of writing concurrent applications using
  threads is difficult and brings several serious issues. Some predictions say that within a few
  years, almost every computer will have about 16 cores, so there is a huge need for programming
  paradigms or idioms that help developers write concurrent software easily (see also <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">The Free Lunch Is Over</a> 
  [<a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm" target="_blank">^</a>] written by Herb Sutter).</p>

<p>Functional programming languages (especially pure functional languages) are interesting from 
  this point of view, because the program doesn't have side-effects which makes it very easy to 
  parallelize it (programs in pure functional languages can't have any side-effects by design, in other functional
  languages like F# the side-effects can be eliminated by following functional programming style). </p>

<p>This article describes the code that makes it possible to parallelize some common F# constructs like the <code>List.map</code> and <code>List.filter</code>...</p>
