    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fsharp-events/">Upcoming F# events - learn Suave, FsLab &amp; more!</a></h1>
    <p>Some people in the F# community have reputation for traveling too much. I do not know how that is
possible, but as it happens, I will be visiting a couple of places in June and doing a number of
talks, workshops and courses. So, if you are thinking about getting into F#, web development with
F# using the <a href="http://suave.io">amazing Suave library</a>, playing with the new trendy F# to JavaScript
compiler <a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable">called Fable</a>, or learning about the recent
features in <a href="https://twitter.com/fslaborg/status/728397249697488896">FsLab and Ionide</a>, then
continue reading!</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fsharp-events/map.png" style="margin:0px 5% 20px 5%; width:90%" />
<p>The map includes all my travels, but not all of the pins are for F# events. I'm visiting Prague
just to see my family (even though there is a <a href="http://www.fsharping.cz">new awesome F# meetup there</a>)
and my stop in Paris is attending <a href="http://www.hapoc.org/hapop3">Symposium for the History and Philosophy of
Programming</a> (although we might still do something with the local F#
group too).</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/restricting-ranges/">Comparing date range handling in C# and F#</a></h1>
    <p>I was recently working on some code for handling date ranges in
<a href="http://github.com/blueMountainCapital/Deedle">Deedle</a>. Although Deedle is written in F#,
I also wrote some internal integration code in C#. After doing that, I realized that the
code I wrote is actually reusable and should be a part of Deedle itself and so I went through
the process of rewriting a simple function from (fairly functional) C# to F#. This is a small
(and by no means representative!) example, but I think it nicely shows some of the reasons why
I like F#, so I thought I'd share it.</p>
<p>One thing that we are adding to Deedle is a "BigDeedle" implementation of internal data
structures. The idea is that you can load very big frames and series without actually loading
all data into memory.</p>
<p>When you perform slicing on a large series and then merge some of the parts of the series
(say, years 2010, 2012 and 2014), you end up with a series that combines a
couple of chunks. If you then restrict the series (say, from June 2012 to June 2014), you
need to restrict the ranges of the chunks:</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/restricting-ranges/drawing.png" alt="Demonstration" style="margin:15px; width:370px" />
<p>As the diagram shows, this is just a matter of iterating over the chunks, keeping those
in the range, dropping those outside of the range and restrictingthe boundaries of the other
chunks. So, let's start with the C# version I wrote.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/csharp-pattern-matching/">Pattern matching in action using C# 6</a></h1>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/csharp-pattern-matching/hat.png" style="float:right;margin:20px" />
<p>On year ago, on this very day, <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/csharp-6-released/index.html">I wrote about the open-sourcing of C#
6.0</a>. Thanks to a very special
information leak, I learned about this about a week before Microsoft officially announced
it. However, my information were slightly incorrect - rather then releasing the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/">much
improved version of the language</a>, Microsoft
continued working on language version internally called "Small C#", which is now available
as "C# 6" in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2015-vs.aspx">Visual Studio 2015 preview</a>.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that, with this release, Microsoft is secretly testing the reaction of the
developer audience to some of the amazing features that F# developers loved and used for
the last 7 years and that are coming to C# <em>very soon</em>. To avoid shock, these are however
carefuly hidden!</p>
<p>In this blog post, I'm going to show you <em>pattern matching</em> which is probably the most useful
hidden C# feature and its improvements in C# 6. For reasons that elude me, pattern matching in
C# 6 is called <em>exception filters</em> and has some unfortunate restrictions. But we can still
use it to write nice functional code!</p>

<p>Since I <a href="https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek/status/544531884030840832">submitted my PhD thesis in December</a>,
I had a little bit of time to finish some of the things that I wanted to do for a really long time, but
never quite found time to actually do them. This included <a href="http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/mac-and-linux.html">getting the R provider to work on
Mac</a> and also creating a new
web site for my various functional programming trainings and books. I even have a nice domain name:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.functional-programming.net">www.functional-programming.net</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The page also discusses a couple of business reasons for looking into functional programming. So, if you're
a business person wondering why you should send your developers on an F# course, the site has the answers
for you too! (Or if you are developer and need a page for your boss.) The other place to check out is the
official <a href="http://www.fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation web page</a> is another great resource and the
<a href="http://fsharp.org/testimonials/">testimonials hosted there</a>.</p>
<p>The page has some information about the <a href="http://functional-programming.net/#trainings">various trainings we're offering at fsharpWorks</a>
and about the two F# books I co-authored (<a href="http://functional-programming.net/rwfp/">Real-World Functional Programming</a> and
brand new <a href="http://functional-programming.net/deepdives/">F# Deep Dives</a>).
I'm happy that we can offer some special deals on both the books and the F# FastTrack course in London,
so if you're considering getting into F#, now is a good time!</p>

<p>I guess that it might be a bit too late for adding to your list of new year's resulution now.
But just if you still have an empty slot (or in case an originally taken slot has become
available), your new year's resolution should be to get involved with F#!</p>
<p>Obviously, the goal of this blog post is to sell you some of my F# trainings and other materials -
including the online course on <a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html">F# in Finance</a> and our
<a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/fast-track.html">FastTrack to F#</a> course in London and New York
and also the <a href="http://manning.com/petricek2">F# Deep Dives</a> book. But to conceal this fact, I'm
going to fill most of the blog post with useful information about F#, the F# Software Foundation
and the F# community (but if you really just want to read about my courses, scroll down to the

<p>At last, the long wait is finally over! After 4 years of waiting, the fully managed implementation
of the C# compiler <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Roslyn">codenamed "Roslyn"</a> has been finally released. In the recent months,
"Roslyn" has been slowly turning into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware">vaporware</a>, but thanks to the recent breakthrough,
the team made an enormous progress over the last two months and even implemented a number of new
C# 6.0 features.</p>
<p>The C# 6.0 compiler, together with <a href="http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#compiler/3.1/Nov2013/src/">the full source code</a> has been released today!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/tuples-in-csharp/">How many tuple types are there in C#?</a></h1>
    <p>In a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18718232/when-should-i-write-my-functions-in-curried-form/18721711">recent StackOverflow question</a>
the poster asked about the difference between <em>tupled</em> and <em>curried</em> form of a function in F#.
In F#, you can use pattern matching to easily define a function that takes a tuple as an argument.
For example, the poster's function was a simple calculation that multiplies the number
of units sold <em>n</em> by the price <em>p</em>:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs1', 1)" class="f">salesTuple</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 2)" class="i">price</span>, <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 3)" class="i">count</span>) <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 4)" class="i">price</span> <span class="o">*</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs4', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs4', 5)" class="f">float</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 6)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 6)" class="i">count</span>)
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The function takes a single argument of type <code>Tuple&lt;float, int&gt;</code> (or, using the nicer F# notation
<code>float * int</code>) and immediately decomposes it into two variables, <code>price</code> and <code>count</code>. The other
alternative is to write a function in the <em>curried</em> form:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs5', 7)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs5', 7)" class="f">salesCurried</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 8)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 8)" class="i">price</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 9)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 9)" class="i">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 10)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 10)" class="i">price</span> <span class="o">*</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs4', 11)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs4', 11)" class="f">float</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 12)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 12)" class="i">count</span>)
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Here, we get a function of type <code>float -&gt; int -&gt; float</code>. Usually, you can read this just as a
function that takes <code>float</code> and <code>int</code> and returns <code>float</code>. However, you can also use <em>partial
function application</em> and call the function with just a single argument - if the price of
an apple is $1.20, we can write <code>salesCurried 1.20</code> to get a <em>new</em> function that takes just
<code>int</code> and gives us the price of specified number of apples. The poster's question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when I want to implement a function that would have taken <em>n &gt; 1</em> arguments,
should I for example always use a curried function in F# (...)? Or should I take
the simple route and use regular function with an n-tuple and curry later on
if necessary?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18718232/when-should-i-write-my-functions-in-curried-form/18721711#18721711">my answer on StackOverflow</a>.
The point of this short introduction was that the question inspired me to think about how
the world looks from the C# perspective...</p>

<p>One (non-NDA) talk was the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2013/02/20/mvp-summit-presentation-on-async.aspx" title="Lucian Wischik, Stephen Toub: Async Clinic">Async Clinic</a> talk about the new <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords
in C# 5.0. Lucian and Stephen talked about common problems that C# developers face when
writing asynchronous programs. In this blog post, I'll look at some of the problems from
the F# perspective. The talk was quite lively, and someone recorded the reaction of the
F# part of the audience as follows...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/variance-explained.aspx/">The theory behind covariance and contravariance in C# 4</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/icon.png" title="Category theory is sometimes called 'general abstract nonsense', but it can actually be useful!" class="rdecor" />

<p>In C# 4.0, we can annotate generic type parameters with <code>out</code> and <code>in</code> annotations to 
specify whether they should behave <em>covariantly</em> or <em>contravariantly</em>. This is mainly
useful when using already defined standard interfaces. Covariance means that you can use
<code>IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;</code> in place where <code>IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;</code> is expected. Contravariance
allows you to pass <code>IComparable&lt;object&gt;</code> as an argument of a method taking <code>IComparable&lt;string&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So far, so good. If you already learned about covariance and contravariance in C# 4, then 
the above two examples are probably familiar. If you're new to the concepts, then 
the examples should make sense (after a bit of thinking, but I'll say more about them). 
However, there is still a number of questions. Is there some easy way to explain the 
two concepts? Why one option makes sense for some types and the other for different types? 
And why the hell is it called <em>covariance</em> and <em>contravariance</em> anyway?</p>

<p>In this blog post, I'll explain some of the mathematics that you can use to think 
about covariance and contravariance.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-generic-numeric.aspx/">F# Math (IV.) - Writing generic numeric code</a></h1>
    
<p>Generic numeric code is some calculation that can be used for working with multiple different numeric 
  types including types such as <code>int</code>, <code>decimal</code> and <code>float</code> or even our own 
  numeric types (such as the type for <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx">clock arithmetic 
  from the previous article of the series</a>). Generic numeric code differs from ordinary generic F# code such 
  as the <code>'a list</code> type or <code>List.map</code> function, because <em>numeric code</em> uses numeric operators 
  such as <code>+</code> or <code>&gt;=</code> that are defined differently for each numeric type.</p>

<p>When writing simple generic code that has some type parameter <code>'T</code>, we don’t know anything about 
  the type parameter and there is no way to restrict it to a numeric type that provides all the operators that 
  we may need to use in our code. This is a limitation of the .NET runtime and F# provides two ways for 
  overcoming it.</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Static member constraints</strong> can be used to write generic code where the actual 
    numeric operations are resolved at compile-time (and a generic function is specialized for all required
    numeric types). This approach makes resulting code very efficient and is generally very easy to use
    when writing a function such as <code>List.sum</code>.</li>

  <li><strong>Global numeric associations</strong> (available in F# PowerPack) give us a way to obtain 
    an interface implementing required numeric operations dynamically at runtime. This approach has some 
    runtime overhead, but can be used for complex numeric types (such as <code>Matrix&lt;'T&gt;</code>).</li>

  <li><strong>Combination of both</strong> techniques can be used to implement complex numeric type
    that is generic over the contained numeric values and has only a minimal runtime overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Static member constraints are a unique feature of F# that is not available in other .NET
  languages, so if you're interested in writing numeric code for .NET,
  this may be a good reason for choosing F#. In C# or Visual Basic, you would be limited to the 
  second option (which can be implemented in C#). In dynamic languages (like IronPython), everything
  is dynamic, so numeric computations can work with any numeric type, but will be significantly
  less efficient. In the rest of the article, we look at the three options summarized above.

<p>In this article, we'll briefly look at two numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. 
  The type <code>complex</code> represents complex numbers consisting of real and imaginary parts. 
  Both parts are stored as a floating point numbers. The type <code>BigRational</code> represents 
  rational numbers consisting of numerator and denominator of arbitrary sizes. Integers of arbitrary
  size are represented using <code>BigInteger</code> type that is available in .NET 4.0 
  (in the <code>System.Numerics.dll</code> assembly). On .NET 2.0, the <code>BigInteger</code>
  type is also a part of F# PowerPack.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/real-world-book-msdn/msdn.jpg" style="float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 15px;" />
<p>More than a year ago, Mike Stephens from <a href="http://manning.com">Manning</a> (who
 was also behind my <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>
 book) asked me if I'd be interested in collaborating on a project for MSDN. The idea 
 was to collaborate with Microsoft on creating some additional content for the official
 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd233154(VS.100).aspx">F# Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the new content appeared on MSDN, so I finally have an excuse for the
  recent lack of blogging! Although the content contains a large number of new articles
  that are not based on my book, you can find it in the MSDN section named after my
  book, right under <em>Visual F#</em>. If you can't wait to check it out, here are all the links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh314518.aspx">Real-World Functional Programming</a> section on MSDN.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?query=tomas%20petricek&amp;f%5B0%5D.Value=tomas%20petricek&amp;f%5B0%5D.Type=SearchText&amp;ac=8">source code for individual chapters</a> is available on MSDN Code Gallery.</li>
  <li>I also published <a href="http://functional-programming.net/msdn/">annotated TOC with source code links</a> on my functional programming web site.</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on the articles, I also wrote about a few topics that we didn't use in the final version. You'll see them on my blog in the next few days, as soon as I edit them into a blog post form. <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/real-world-book-msdn.aspx">Continue reading</a> for more information about individual chapters.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-loosely-typed/goto.png" style="float:right;margin:0px 0px 15px 15px;" />

<p>About two weeks ago, I gave a talk at <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/">GOTO Conference</a> in
  Copenhagen at a very interesting .NET session organized by <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk /">Mark Seemann</a>.
  In my talk, I focused on the impedance mismatch between the data structures that are used
  in programming languages (such as classes in C# or records and discriminated unions in F#)
  and the data structures that we need to access (such as database, XML files and REST services).
   </p>

<p>Clearly, both of the sides have <em>some structure</em> (otherwise, it wouldn't be possible
  to write any code against them!). Even an XML file that is returned by a REST service has some
  structure - although the only way to find out about the structure may be to call the service
  and then look at the result. In this article, I'll briefly summarize the ideas that I 
  presented in the talk. Here are links to the slides as well as the source code from the 
  talk: </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/formlets-in-linq.aspx/">Beyond the Monad fashion (II.): Creating web forms with LINQ</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/formlets-in-linq/screen.png" style="margin:15px;float:right;" />
<p>The LINQ query syntax can be used for various things. Aside from writing queries, you can 
  also use it to encode any <em>monads</em>. This has become a fashionable topic, so you can learn
  more about it at many .NET conferences (for example <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=434">GOTO 2011</a>).
  There are also many blog posts on this topic and I explained it in details in Chapter 12 of <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">my book</a>, which
  is available as a <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/SampleChapter12.pdf">free sample chapter</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>However, you can also use LINQ syntax for writing different types of computations. In a 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx">previous blog post</a>, I introduced <em>idioms</em>
  (also called <em>applicative functors</em>) and I demonstrated how to use the <code>join</code> syntax in LINQ
  to write computations based on idioms. We looked at a slightly boring, but simple example - zipping of lists - and
  we also implemented matrix transposition.</p>
 
<p>In this blog post, we look at a more exciting example. I explain <em>formlets</em>, which is an <em>idiom</em>
  for building web forms. Formlets give us an elegant functional way to create reusable components that encapsulate
  both visual aspect (HTML) and behavior (processing of requests). You can think of them as functional ASP.NET controls.
  Formlets come from the <a href="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/formlets/">Links project</a> and they are now used in commercial products like
  <a href="http://www.websharper.com/tutorials/GettingStartedWithFormlets.aspx">WebSharper</a>. In this article, you'll see that we can (mis)use LINQ to get a nicer syntax
  for writing code using formlets. My C# implementation of formlets is based on a nice <a href="http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/2011/01/simple-implementation-of-formlets-in-f.html">F# formlets by Mauricio
  Scheffer</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx/">Beyond the Monad fashion (I.): Writing idioms in LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>Thanks to LINQ and Erik Meier, monads have become a fashionable topic in the C# developer community.
  Indeed, no serious developer conference on .NET can get away without having a talk on monads. The attractive
  thing about LINQ and monads is that the <code>SelectMany</code> operator roughly corresponds to the <em>bind</em>
  function that defines a monad. In practice, LINQ is used for working with collections of data (<code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>),
  but you can also define <em>bind</em> (i.e. <code>SelectMany</code>) for some other data types and use the LINQ syntax
  for working with other types. You won't be really using the full LINQ syntax. You'll probably use just nested
  <code>from</code> clauses (for <em>binding</em>) and <code>select</code> at the end to return the result.</p>

<p>However, monads are not the only notion of computation that we can work with. More interestingly, they are also 
  not the only notion of computation that you can encode using LINQ! In this article, I'll briefly introduce 
  <em>idioms</em> (also called <em>applicative functors</em>), which is another useful abstract type of computations.
  Idioms can be used for a few things that cannot be done using monads.</p>

<p>A provocative summary of this article is: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">"Everyone who tells you that LINQ is a monad is wrong!"</span></p>

<p>The truth is
that LINQ syntax can be used for encoding <em>queries</em> (obviously), <em>monads</em> (as you were told), but also for <em>idioms</em> as you'll learn today (and quite possibly for other types of computations). In this article, we look at a basic example, but I'll describe a more complex real-world scenario in the next blog post.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-compilation-internals.aspx/">Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</a></h1>
    
<p>Some time ago, I started writing a series about the differences between the asynchronous model in F# 
  (in Visual Studio 2010) and the asynchronous language extensions for C# proposed at PDC 2010.
  In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">first article</a>, I showed
  how both of the language features look and I highlighted a couple of differences. In the
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">second article</a>, I discussed
  the support for cancellation (available only in F#) and how the two models differ 
  <em>semantically</em> (i.e. what are differences in the behaviour). However, I didn't talk about more
  techincal differences and, in particular, how is the asynchronous code compiled. We'll look 
  at this topic today...</p>

<p>Although the C# asynchronous programming model is very similar to F# asynchronous workflows,
  the compilation looks quite different. The C# compiler uses a similar technique as when compiling
  iterators and creates a state machine, while the F# compiler uses an approach based on higher order
  functions (combinators) that's shared with (most) other computation expressions.</p>

<p>I won't discuss the syntax of F# asynchronous workflows or the C# asynchronous extensions in 
  this article, so if you're new to one of these, here are links to other articles in this 
  series: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (I.): Simultaneous introduction</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (II.): How do they differ?</a></li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</strong></li>
  <li>Asynchronous C# and F# (IV.): Calling F# libraries from C# <em>(not yet available)</em></li>
</ul>  

<p>Let's start by looking at the mechanism used in the C# compiler. If you already know how
  iterators work in C# 2.0, then you'll find it quite easy to understand. If you're not familiar
  with iterators, then don't worry - I'll make the explanation self-contained.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx/">Asynchronous C# and F# (II.): How do they differ?</a></h1>
    
<p>Anders Hejlsberg announced the support for asynchronous programming in the next version of C# announced at PDC 2010.
  The extension looks very similar to F# asynchronous workflows (which are already available in Visual Studio 2010). 
  Despite the large similarity, there are a couple of differences between the two programming models. I already mentioned 
  some of them briefly in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">the first article of this series</a>.
  In this article, we'll look at some of the technical differences between the two models.</p>

<p>The most notable non-technical difference is that F# asynchronous workflows are already available in a 
  supported version of Visual Studio and can be used on a large number of .NET runtimes (including, for example,
  Windows Phone and Silverlight). However, there are surprisingly many technical differences as well.
  In this article, I'll talk about the support for cancellation, which is available in F# and is not
  (currently) available in the C# preview. We'll also look at the difference between model where tasks
  are created as running and the delayed model.</p>

<p>This article is the second part of a short series about the asynchronous programming support
  in C# and F#. The previous article shows a simple example in both of the languages and the next
  articles explain how does the feature work (and how you can customize its behavior) as well as 
  how to call F# libraries from C#:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (I.): Simultaneous introduction</a></li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous C# and F# (II.): How do they differ?</strong></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-compilation-internals.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</a></li>
  <li>Asynchronous C# and F# (IV.): Calling F# libraries from C# <em>(not yet available)</em></li>

<p>Let's start by looking at, perhaps, the most important technical difference - the

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/csharp-fsharp-async-intro/pdc2010.png" style="float:right;margin:5px;margin-left:20px;" />
<p>One of the exciting new technologies that was announced at <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/">PDC 2010</a>
  is the support for <em>asynchronous programming</em> in C#. So what exactly is <em>asynchronous programming</em>?
  Many applications today need to connect to some service or external data source including, for example, 
  Web Services and REST APIs. These calls may take a long time to run, but we want to run them without
  blocking the application.</p>

<p>Currently, you can run the operation on a background thread or using a <code>Task</code>, but
  coordinating multiple such operations is difficult. What if you for example need to wait until
  any (or all) of downloads complete and run some more code then? This is not only difficult, but
  it also scales badly, because blocking .NET threads is a bad practice (Threads are expensive and when
  they're just waiting for other operation to complete, we're wasting valuable resources).
  This problem has been the main motivation for including <em>asynchronous workflows</em> in F#
  about 3 years ago. In F#, this also enabled various interesting programming styles - for example
  <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx" type="external">creating 
  GUI using asynchronous workflows</a> (also discussed in Chapter 16 of <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">my book</a> and in 
  in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx">my recent talk</a>). The C# asynchronous 
  programming support and the <code>await</code> keyword is largely inspired by
  F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em> (I was quite surprised that F# wasn't more visibly 
  mentioned in the PDC talk).
</p>

<p>In this article series, I'll demonstrate both F# and C# asynchronous programming model,
  I'll look at features that are missing in one or the other as well as a few subtle differences
  (that may be unexpected) and finally, I'll write about writing (asynchronous) F# libraries 
  that are easy to use from C#. The plan for the series is following:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/custom-linq-grouping.aspx/">Using custom grouping operators in LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>You can use LINQ to write queries that perform grouping of data using <code>group by</code>
  or ordering of data using <code>orderby</code> clause. LINQ provides the default
  (and the most common) implementation of both of the operations, but sometimes you 
  may need a slightly different behavior when grouping or ordering data (this article
  is motivated by a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2194761/can-i-use-linq-to-retrieve-only-on-change-values" type="external">question on StackOverflow</a>
  which needs to do exactly that for grouping).</p>
  
<p>Let's look at a simple example, which shows when we may need a different behavior when 
  grouping data. For example, we may have the following list of stock trades
  containing a name of a stock and the price of the trade (stored for example as a list
  of <code>TradeInfo</code> classes with properties <code>Name</code> and <code>Price</code>):</p>  
<pre lang="csharp">
{ { Name = "MSFT", Price = 80.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 70.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 100.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 200.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 300.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 30.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 20.00 } }</pre>  
<p>Now, we may want to group adjacent trades into a single summary record which will contain
  the name of the stock (which is same for all trades in each group), the number of trades 
  in the group and an average price in the group. The desired results are:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
{ { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 75.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Count = 3, AvgPrice = 200.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 25.00 } }</pre>  
<p>The operation that we want to do is very similar to <code>group by</code> in LINQ, but 
  it doesn't do quite the same thing! If we used <code>group by</code>, we would get only 
  two groups as the result. However, as I wrote earlier, we want to group only 
  <em>adjacent trades</em>. You could write your own extension method to do this,
  but then you need to leave the elegant LINQ query syntax. In this article, I'll show
  you how to get the desired results using a simple LINQ query with a <code>group by</code>
  clause...</p>

<p>As you can see, there has been quite a bit of silence on this blog for a while. 
  There are two reasons for that - the first is that I'm still working on the book 
  <a type="external" href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real World Functional
  Programming</a>, so all my writing activities are fully dedicated to the book. The second
  reason is that I'm having a great time doing an internship in the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/ppt">Programming Principles and Tools</a> group
  at Microsoft Research in Cambridge with the F# team and namely the F# language 
  designer <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" type="external">Don Syme</a>.

  I just wanted to post a quick update with some information (and downloads!) related

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-overview.aspx/">Functional Programming in .NET using C# and F# (Manning Greenpaper)</a></h1>
    
<p>
  Functional programming languages have been around for a while and were always astonishing for their 
  ability to express the ideas in a succinct, declarative way allowing the developer to focus on the 
  essence of problem rather than on technical details of the solution. Recently, functional paradigm is 
  gaining new prominence as an efficient way to handle development of multi-processor, parallel and 
  asynchronous applications.</p>

<p>
  Functional ideas are arising in C# as well as in other main-stream languages and functional languages 
  are becoming an alternative for real-world projects.  Also, Microsoft recently introduced a new 
  language called F#, which has a strong background in traditional functional languages, but as a .NET 
  language also benefits from the rich .NET and Visual Studio ecosystem.</p>

<p>
  This article is partially an excerpt from my book <strong><a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a></strong> [<a href="#fpgpref">1</a>]. 
  Thanks to my editors at <a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external">Manning</a> I have the permission
  to publish it on my blog. We’ll look at several aspects of functional programming and how the same 
  concepts, which are essential for the functional paradigm, look in the F# and in C# 3.0 with LINQ. We 
  will shortly look at the basic programming language features like lambda functions and type inference 
  that are now available in both F# and C#. Functional programming isn’t only about language features, 
  but also about using different programming style, so we’ll look at some high level concepts as well. 
  These include using immutable data structures for developing code that can be executed in parallel 
  and writing code in a more declarative style.</p>

<p>
  Thanks to the combination of C# 3.0 and F#, this article shows the ideas in a way that should be 
  familiar to you in C#, but also shows a further step that you can take with a primarilly functional
  language F#. If you're a .NET developer and you want to understand what functional programming is
  and how it can help you to become better and more productive then continue reading. If you'll find 
  this article interesting, then don't forget to check out the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">book</a>,
  which explains everything in larger detail and discusses many other interesting ideas.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-iv-reactivegame.aspx/">Reactive Programming (IV.) - Developing a game in Reactive LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>In this part of the article series about <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>we're going to 
  implement a slightly more complicated application using the library that I introduced
  in the previous three articles. We're going to use basic event stream queries from the <a href="reactive-ii-csevents.aspx">second article</a> 
  as well as advanced operators introduced in the <a href="reactive-iii-linqoperators.aspx">third part</a>.
  This time, I'll also show the F# version of all the examples, so we're going to build on the ideas from
  the <a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">first part</a>.</p>

<p>I originally wanted to write the demo only in Visual Basic, because I think that
  it is really amazig to show an idea that came from functional programming in a language
  that no one (maybe until recently) connects with functional programming. Then I realized that
  I really want to show the F# version too, because F# was an inspiration for the whole
  <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> idea and it is interesting alone as well. But finally,
  I thought that don't showing the C# version may look offensive to many readers (especially 
  since I'm still C# MVP...). So, I ended up writing the game in all three languages, but 
  the code is surprisingly similar in all of them!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-iii-linqoperators.aspx/">Reactive Programming (III.) - Useful Reactive LINQ Operators</a></h1>
    
<p>In the <a href="reactive-ii-csevents.aspx">previous article</a>, I introduced <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>.
  I explained the different point of view that we can use when working with .NET events. The idea is that
  .NET events can be viewed as streams of values. The value is information about the event (such as position
  of a mouse click or a mouse movement). These streams can be processed using LINQ queries - we can for example
  filter all values that are not interesting for us using <code>where</code> LINQ clause. For example if we want to handle
  clicks only in some specified area.</p>
<p>In the previous article, I talked about basic LINQ query operators such as <code>select</code> and <code>where</code>
  and some useful methods that <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> provides (for example for merging event streams).
  Today, we'll take a look at two more advanced kinds of operations that we can use for working with event streams. 
  In particular, we'll talk about aggregation operators (that you certainly know from LINQ) and about switching. 
  Switching is a concept from functional reactive programming and it allows us to change dynamically how the 
  application behaves. However, I'll explain this in a more detail soon.</p>
<p>In this article, I'm going to use mostly C# (and some Visual Basic). The functionality that I'm describing
  in this part isn't part of the standard F# <code>Event</code> module that I discussed in 
  <a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">the first part</a>. I implemented most of them in F# too, but I'm not going
  to write the samples in both of the versions in this part. If you've seen the first two articles, you'll be 
  definitely able to use the F# versions as well, because they follow exactly the same ideas as the C#/LINQ versions.
  I'm going to talk about a larger demo application in the last section and I'll show an F# version as well,
  so you'll see some F# examples in the next part. This part serves more as a reference of the available
  operators, so you may read only some parts of it, then jump to the last one (to see an exciting example!) 
  and then come back here.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-ii-csevents.aspx/">Reactive programming (II.) - Introducing Reactive LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article I'm going to introduce my project <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>. This is largely inspired
  by the ideas that come from functional reactive programming in the Haskell language and from 
  functionality that's available for working in events in F#. I introduced these ideas in my previous article
  in this mini-series, so if you're interested in learning more about these interesting technologies, you 
  should definitely read the previous article about <a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">First class events in F#</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we're going to look how to apply the same ideas to the C# language and how 
  to use LINQ queries for processing events. This article is <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx">just</a>&#160;<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx">another</a> my article that shows how to implement some 
  idea from functional programmin in C#. I believe this will once again show that the new features
  in the C# 3.0 aren't just about querying databases, but are more widely useful even in situations 
  that are not directly related to data-processing. </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-i-fsevents.aspx/">Reactive programming (I.) - First class events in F#</a></h1>
    
<p>I believe that the LINQ project and changes in C# 3.0 and VB 9 are interesting because they 
  allow rewriting of many ideas from functional programming. An ability to express queries easily
  is one of these ideas, but it is definitely not the only one. There are many other interesting ideas.
  The C# 3.0 language isn't primary a functional language, so it isn't easy to discover the idea
  if you use only C#, but it is possible to implement it if you know the idea already.</p>
<p>I already wrote a few interesting C# examples that were inspired by some functional idea.
  I'm a big fan of the F# language, so it is not a surprise that I started with an F# version
  of the problem and then looked at the way to do the same thing in C#. In particular, this is 
  how my article about building dynamic queries in C# came to the existence - the F# version used
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-flinq.aspx">FLINQ and Quotations</a> and then I demonstrated how to do the same in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx">C# 
  using expression trees</a>. Another example is my article about asynchronous 
  programming in C# <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx">using iterators</a>, which shows how to implement something 
  like F# <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/11/introducing-f-asynchronous-workflows.aspx">asynchronous workflows using iterators</a> in C# 2.0.</p>

<h3>Functional Reactive Programming</h3>  
<p>Today, I'm going to look at another very interesting idea from functional programming. It is 
  called <em>Functional Reactive Programming</em> and it comes from the Haskell community. You can find 
  a list of related <a href="http://www.haskell.org/frp/" type="external">Haskell projects here</a>.
  However, similar things (though they are not purely functional and simplified) are available 
  in the F# language as well. Don Syme introduced them in his blog post called 
  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2006/03/24/559582.aspx">F# First Class Events: Simplicity and Compositionality in Imperative Reactive Programming</a>. In this article, I'm going to briefly introduce the implementation
  available in F# and I'll extend it a little bit to allow some more interesting things. In the 
  second article from this series, I'll show how to implement the same thing in C# 3.0 (and in VB 9 too!)</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/sequences-on-msdn.aspx/">Calculating with infinite sequences on MSDN</a></h1>
    
<p>About a year ago, I wrote <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/lazy-computation-on-msdn.aspx">an article</a> about using lazy computations in C# 3.0. It was published by the C# Community PM <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/" type="external">Charlie Calvert</a> at the C# Developer Center. The article was a first of two articles where I wanted to demonstrate that C# 3.0 can be used for implementing useful constructs known from functional languages. I realized that I never posted the link to the second article to my blog, so you can find the annotation and link below.</p>

<p>However, I remembered about these two articles because I was just working on chapters 11 and 12 of the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-net-update.aspx">Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a> book that I’m writing. Lazy values, which were the topic of my first article, are discussed in the second part of chapter 11 and IEnumerable and F# sequences are the topic for the first part of chapter 12. Because I already wrote two articles on this topic, I had to think really hard to find better (and still simple enough) examples where these concepts are useful in practice. I also finally have enough space to show how these two concepts relate and talk about some interesting background – for example in Haskell, lazy sequences are in fact just ordinary lists that are lazy thanks to the Haskell nature. </p>
<p>A year ago, I definitely wouldn’t believe that today, I’ll be writing about the same topics, but this time as part of a book that has partly the same goal as these two articles – to show that functional programming ideas are really useful in the real-world and can enrich your programming toolbox (no matter whether you’re using C# or F# language). Anyway, here is the link to the second article – as usual when I look at something that I worked on a long time ago, I think I should rewrite it to make it better :-), but it still gives you an idea what is the book that I’m working on about...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-net-update.aspx/">Functional Programming in .NET book - An update</a></h1>
    
<p>Recently, I announced on my blog that I’m working on a book for <a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external">Manning</a> 
  called <em>Real world Functional Programming in .NET</em>. The goal of the book is to explain the most interesting and
  useful ideas of functional programming to a real world C# developer. I'm writing this book, because I believe that functional programming is becoming
  increasingly important. Here is a couple of reasons why you should have this book on your bookshelf:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ideas behind C# 3.0 and LINQ</strong> - these main-stream technologies are inspired by functional programming and the new 
    C# 3.0 features give us definitely much more than just a new way to query databases. The book explains
    the ideas behind these features and shows how to use them more efficiently.</li>
    
  <li><strong>Learning the F# language</strong> - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx" type="external">F# is becoming a first-class citizen</a>
    in the Visual Studio family of languages, which alone would be a good reason for learning it! Even if you're not going
    to use it for your next large .NET project, you'll find it useful for quick prototyping of ideas and testing how .NET libraries
    work thanks to the great interactive tools.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Real world examples</strong> - the book includes a large set of real-world examples that show how to develop 
    real applications in a functional way - both in F# and C#. Among other things, the examples show how to utilize multi-core 
    CPUs, how to better obtain and process data and how to implement animations and GUI applications in a functional way.</li>
</ul>  

<p>The book is available via the MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) and if you want to get a better idea what is the book about, 
  you can read the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/" type="external">first chapter for free</a>. Anyway, it is more than a month since I  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-programming-book.aspx">posted the announcement</a>, so I decided to write a brief update....</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx/">Asynchronous Programming in C# using Iterators</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article we will look how to write programs that perform asynchronous operations without 
  the typical inversion of control. To briefly introduce what I mean by 'asynchronous' and 
  'inversion of control' - asynchronous refers to programs that perform some long running operations 
  that don't necessary block a calling thread, for example accessing the network, calling web services 
  or performing any other I/O operation in general. The inversion of control refers to the code structure 
  that you have to use when writing a code that explicitly passes a C# delegate as a callback to the
  asynchronous method (typically called <code>Begin<em>Something</em></code> in .NET). The asynchronous method
  calls the delegate when the operation completes, which reverses the way you write the code - instead of
  encoding the control flow using typical language constructs (e.g. <code>while</code> loop) you have to 
  use global variables and write your own control mechanism.</p>
<p>The funny thing about this article is that it could have been written at least 3 years ago when
  a beta version of Visual Studio 2005 and C# 2.0 became first available, but it is using iterators in 
  a slightly bizarre way, so it is not easy to realize that this is possible. Actually, I will use some C# 3.0
  methods in the article as well, but only extension methods and mainly just to keep the code nicer. As with 
  my earlier article about building LINQ queries at runtime, I realized that it can be done in C# when I was playing with 
  the F# solution (called F# Asynchronous Workflows), where this approach is very natural, so I will shortly
  mention the F# implementation as well.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/lazy-computation-on-msdn.aspx/">Lazy Computation in C# on MSDN</a></h1>
    
<p>I think that one of the interesting things about C# 3.0 is that it gives you the ability to use many techniques known from functional languages (like Haskell or F#). Most of the articles about C# 3.0 and LINQ focus on the queries and LINQ to SQL, but I believe that using these functional techniques deserve some attention as well. This is why I'm very happy that my article about one of these techniques - representing lazy computations - is now available at the C# Developer Center. I would like to thank to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/default.aspx">Charlie Calvert</a> [<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/default.aspx" target="_blank">^</a>], who is the Community Program Manager for C# and who edited and published my article there. Here is the annotation:</p>

<p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">Most of the programming languages used in practice (including for example C#, VB.NET, C++, Python or Java) employ so called eager evaluation, which means that the program evaluates all expression and statements in the order in which they are written, so all the preceding statements and expressions are evaluated before executing the next piece of code. This, for example, means that all arguments to a method call are evaluated before calling the method. Sometimes it may be useful to delay an execution of some code until the result is actually needed, either because the result may not be needed at all (but we can’t tell that before executing some computation) or because we don’t want to block the program for a long time by executing all computations in advance and instead we want to execute the computations later, when we will actually need the result. </p>

<p style="padding-left:40px;margin-bottom:20px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">In this article we will look how these lazy computations can be written in C# (using some of the new language features from version 3.0). We will first implement a Lazy class to represent this kind of computation, then look at a few simple examples to demonstrate how the class can be used, and finally we will examine one slightly more complicated, but practically useful application.

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-flinq.aspx/">Building LINQ Queries at Runtime in F#</a></h1>
    
<p>In an article about building LINQ queries at runtime in C# 3.0, I described how you can build
  a LINQ query dynamically, for example by combining a set of conditions using the 'or' operator in the
  where clause. I mentioned that the way I implemented it is largely influenced by the F# language, 
  which provides very natural way for manipulations with code like this. In this article I will first 
  shortly introduce FLINQ sample, which is an F# library implementing LINQ support and than I will 
  implement the same examples I presented in the earlier article in F#.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx/">Building LINQ Queries at Runtime in C#</a></h1>
    
<p>Since the first beta versions of LINQ we could hear comments that it is perfect for 
  queries known at compile-time, however it is not possible to use it for building queries 
  dynamically at runtime. In this article I show that this can be actually done very well for 
  most of the common cases. The solution offered by Microsoft (mentioned in [<a href="#dynqlinks">1</a>]) is to 
  build query from a string, however this has many limitations and it in fact goes completely 
  against what LINQ tries to achieve, which is writing queries in a type-safe way with full 
  compile-time checking. In this article I will first show a few support functions to make the life 
  a bit easier and then we will use them for building two sample applications that allows user to 
  build a query dynamically. The solution is largely motivated by my previous use of F#, where 
  working with “expressions” is possible at more advanced level, however I’ll write about F# later 
  and now let’s get back to C# 3.0...</p>

<p>I started working on this project, because I attended C++ class at our university and I had to do some application in C++. Because I hate doing useless projects I wanted to work on something interesting and so I started thinking whether it would be possible to enable LINQ support in C++/CLI...</p>

<p>C++/CLI is a very flexible language and the following example proves that enabling LINQ support in C++/CLI isn't impossible. The following database query returns name of contact and company for all customers living in London:</p>

<pre lang="c++">
// create connection to database
NorthwindData db(".. connection string ..");

// declare database query
Expr&lt;Customers^&gt; cvar = Var&lt;Customers^&gt;("c");
CQuery&lt;String^&gt;^ q = db.QCustomers
  -&gt;Where(clq::fun(cvar, cvar.City == "London"))
  -&gt;Select(clq::fun(cvar, 
      cvar.ContactName + Expr&lt;String^&gt;(", ") + cvar.CompanyName));

// execute query and output results

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/cannot-return-anonymous-type-from-method.aspx/">Can't return anonymous type from method? Really?</a></h1>
    
<p>One of the new features introduced in C# 3.0 which will be available in Visual Studio "Orcas" (currently in CTP version) 
  is anonymous type. Anonymous type is something very similar to tuple type from Cω [<a href="#returnanonymous">1</a>] (which is based 
  on tuple types known from many functional programming languages including F#). Anonymous types are extremely useful in 
  LINQ queries, because it allows you to construct type with several properties without declaring the type (with all the properties).
  Example of query with anonymous type looks like this:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var q = from c in db.Customers
        where c.Country = "Czech Republic"
        select new { FullName=c.Name+" "+c.Surname, Address=c.Address };
</pre>  
<p>Ok, it's probabbly not the best example, but it demonstrates the point - you want to return some information from query
  and you don't need to declare type that contains <code>FullName</code> and <code>Address</code> properties before, because
  you need it only for this single query (and you want to return only these two fields, so you don't transfer additional 
  data that you don't need from database).</p><p>Now let's get to the second point... </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp3-concepts.aspx/">Concepts behind the C# 3.0 language</a></h1>
    
<p>One of the lectures that I attended last year was <a href="http://www.mff.cuni.cz/toISO-8859-2.en/vnitro/is/sis/predmety/kod.php?kod=PRG003">Programming Methodology and Philosophy of Programming Languages</a>. The lecture was mostly about history of programming languages and how several features evolved, disappeared and than after many years appeared again in another programming language.</p>

<p>As I final work I decided to write an article that describes ideas that influenced the design of the C# 3.0 language. Some of these features are known from functional languages (for example from LISP or Haskell), some other were developed at Microsoft Research and appeared in the F# language or Cω. I also wanted to show in what ways are these features limited in the C# 3.0. I think that thanks to these limitation, the C# 3.0 is still a simple (or at least not difficult) to understand which is very important for mainstream language, but I find it interesting to know what is possible in other (less limited) languages.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/linq-expand-update.aspx/">LINQ extensions - Simplified keyword search</a></h1>
    
<p>Recently, I came across interesting question at LINQ Forums (Dynamic conditions: How to achieve multiple "OR" conditions with LINQ? [<a href="#updlq">1</a>]).
  The question is whether LINQ (and especially LINQ to SQL) provides any simple way to return only records that contain one or more of 
  specified keywords in the name. The question looks simple, but it is simple only if you know the number of keywords that you want to 
  look for. In this case you can write following LINQ query:</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c">// Products that contain "kwd1" or "kwd2" in the name </span><br />
  <span class="k">var</span> q = <span class="k">from</span> p <span class="k">in</span> db.Products
    <span class="k">where</span> p.ProductName.Contains("kwd1") || p.ProductName.Contains("kwd2")
    <span class="k">select</span> p;
</pre>
<p>The problem with previous code is that you can't use it if the list of keywords is dynamically entered by user
  (and so its length may vary). Of course, if you want to run query on in-memory data, you can get very nice results by
  writing extension method called <code>ContainsAny</code> that performs test for keyword array, but if you 
  want to be able to translate query to SQL, the situation is a bit complicated.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/linq-expand.aspx/">Calling functions in LINQ queries</a></h1>
    
<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ref/linq/">LINQ Project</a> [<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ref/linq/" target="_blank">^</a>] is 
  an extension to .NET Framework and most important .NET languages (C# and VB.Net) that extends these languages with query operators and some 
  language features that make it possible to integrate queries in the languages. Thanks to LINQ you can write queries that read data from database
  (or any other data source). For example, imagine that you want to write set of queries for eshop and you need to perform a price calculation
  in more queries. The problem with LINQ queries is that you can't simply call a function written in C# that calculates price. The following example
  is NOT WORKING for this reason:</p>
<pre>
<span class="c">// function used in filter</span><br />
<span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">decimal</span> CalcPrice(Nwind.Product p)
{
  <span class="k">return</span> p.UnitPrice * 1.19m;
}</pre>
<pre>
<span class="c">// query that uses MyFunc</span><br />
<span class="k">var</span> q = 
  <span class="k">from</span> p <span class="k">in</span> db.Products
  <span class="k">where</span> CalcPrice(p) &gt; 30m
  <span class="k">select</span> p
</pre>
<p>I think that this is a big limitation, because when you want to keep some more complex logic in the data access layer you should be able to reuse 
  parts of queries that are similar across more queries. The good thing is that with latest release, LINQ became extensible so it is possible
  to write a extensions that allow this scenario...</p>
