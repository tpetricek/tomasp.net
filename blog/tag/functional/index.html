    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/youdraw-compost-visualization/">Creating interactive You Draw bar chart with Compost</a></h1>
    <p>For a long time, I've been thinking about how to design a data visualization library that would
make it easier to compose charts from simple components. On the one hand, there are charting libraries
like <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart">Google Charts</a>, which offer a long list of pre-defined
charts. On the other hand, there are libraries like <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, which let you
construct any data visualization, but in a very low-level way. There is also <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/">Vega</a>,
based the idea of <em>grammar of graphics</em>, which is somewhere in between, but requires you to
specify charts in a fairly complex language including <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/transforms/">a huge number of transformations</a>
that you need to write in JSON.</p>
<p>In the spirit of functional domain specific languages, I wanted to have a small number of
simple but powerful primitives that can be composed by writing code in a normal programming language
like F# or JavaScript, rather than using JSON.</p>
<p>My final motivation for working on this was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/15/us/politics/you-draw-obama-legacy.html">You Draw It article series</a>
by New York Times, which uses interactive charts where the reader first has to make their own guess
before seeing the actual data. I wanted to recreate this, but for bar charts, when working on
<a href="http://turing.thegamma.net/expenditure/">visualizing government spending using The Gamma</a>.</p>
<p>The code for this was somewhat hidden inside The Gamma, but last month, I finally extracted all
the functionality into a new stand-alone library <a href="https://compostjs.github.io/compost/">Compost.js</a>
with simple and clean <a href="https://github.com/compostjs/compost">source code on GitHub</a> and
an accompanying <a href="https://compostjs.github.io/compost/paper.pdf">paper draft that describes it (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, I will show how to use Compost.js to implement a "You Draw" bar chart inspired
by the NYT article. When loaded, all bars show the average value. You have to drag
the bars to positions that you believe represent the actual values. Once you do this, you can
click "Show me how I did" and the chart will animate to show the actual data, revealing how good
your guess was. Before looking at the code, you can have a look at the resulting interactive chart,
showing the top 5 areas from the 2015 UK budget (in % of GDP):</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2019/first-language/">What to teach as the first programming language and why</a></h1>
    <p>The number of Google search results for the phrase
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=" title="choosing+the+first+programming+language">"choosing the first programming language"</a>
at the time of writing is 15,800. This illustrates just how debated the issue of choosing the first
programming language is. In this blog post, I will not actually try to answer the question posed
in the title of the post. I will not discuss what language we should teach as the first one.
Instead, I will look at a more interesting question.</p>
<p>I will investigate the arguments that are used in favour of or against particular programming
languages in computer science curriculum. I am more interested in the kind of argumentation that
is employed to support a particular choice than in the specific languages involved. This approach is
valuable for two reasons. First, by looking at the argumentation used, we can learn what educators
consider important about computer science. Second, understanding the motivations behind different
arguments allows us to make our own debates about the choice of a programming language more informed.</p>
<p>The scope of this blog post is limited to the choice of the first programming language taught in an
undergraduate computer science programmes at universities. This means that I will not discuss other
important contexts such as choices at a primary or a secondary education level, choices for
independent learners and choices in other university degrees that might involve programming.</p>
<p>Note that this blog post is adapted from an essay that I wrote as part of a
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/teaching/qualifications/pgche/">Postgrduate Certificate for Higher Education programme</a>
at University of Kent, so it assumes less knowledge about programming than a typical reader of
my blog has. This makes it accessible to a broader audience thinking about education
though!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/write-your-own-excel/">Write your own Excel in 100 lines of F#</a></h1>
    <p>I've been teaching F# for over seven years now, both in the public F# FastTrack course that we run
at SkillsMatter in London and in various custom trainings for private companies. Every time I teach
the F# FastTrack course, I modify the material in one way or another. I wrote about some of this
interesting history <a href="#">last year in an fsharpWorks article</a>. The course now has a stable half-day
introduction to the language and a stable focus on the ideas behind functional-first programming,
but there are always new examples and applications that illustrate this style of programming.</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/write-your-own-excel/logo.png" class="rdecor" />
<p>When we started, we mostly focused on teaching functional programming concepts that might be useful
even if you use C# and on building analytical components that your could integrate into a larger
.NET solution. Since then, the F# community has matured, established the <a href="http://fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation</a>,
but also built a number of mature end-to-end ecosystems that you can rely on such as <a href="http://fable.io">Fable</a>,
the F# to JavaScript compiler, and <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io">SAFE Stack</a> for full-stack web development.</p>
<p>For the upcoming December course in London, I added a number of demos and hands-on tasks built
using Fable, partly because running F# in a browser is an easy way to illustrate many concepts
and partly because Fable has some amazing functional-first libraries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="font-size:110%;margin:0px 5px 0px 0px"></i></em>
If you are interested in learning F# and attending our course, the next <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/courses/473-tomas-petricek-phil-trelford-fast-track-to-fsharp">F# FastTrack</a>
takes place on <strong>6-7 December</strong> in London at SkillsMatter. We also offer custom
on-site trainings. Get in touch at <a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">@tomaspetricek</a>
or email <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a> for a 10% discount for the course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the new samples I want to show, which I also <a href="https://vimeo.com/281241807">live coded at NDC 2018</a>,
is building a simple web-based Excel-like spreadsheet application. The spreadsheet demonstrates
all the great F# features such as domain modeling with types, the power of compositionality
and also how functional-first approach can be amazingly powerful for building user interfaces.</p>

<p>Autumn is a busy period and I already invited you to a 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/events-autumn-2012.aspx">couple of interesting events</a>, 
  but there are two more events that you definitely should not miss.
  In only two weeks, you can come to two-day <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progfsharp-2012">Progressive F# Tutorials</a>
  packed with tutorials for both F# beginners and experts. At the beginning of December,
  the <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/">TechMesh Conference</a> comes with three days of
  talks about alternative (and future) technologies.
</p>

<p>I'll be speaking at both Progressive F# Tutorials and TechMesh and I'm also doing a tutorial
  at TechMesh, so if you want to learn about F#, type providers in F# 3.0 and financial computing
  with F#, here are some talks that you should not miss...

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx/">Why type-first development matters</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/type-first-development/tfd.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>Using functional programming language changes the way you write code in a number
of ways. Many of the changes are at a <em>small-scale</em>. For example, you learn how to express
computations in a shorter, more declarative way using higher-order functions.
However, there are also many changes at a <em>large-scale</em>. The most notable one
is that, when designing a program, you start thinking about the (data) types
that represent the data your code works with.</p>

<p>In this article, I describe this approach. Since the acronym TDD is already taken,
I call the approach Type-First Development (TFD), which is probably a better name anyway.
The development is not <em>driven</em> by types. It <em>starts</em> with types, but the rest of the
implementation can still use test-driven development for the implementation.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates the approach using a case study from a real life:
My example is a project that I started working on with a friend who needed a
system to log journeys with a company car (for expense reports). Using the
type-first approach made it easier to understand and discuss the problem.</p>

<p>In many ways, TFD is a very simple approach, so this article just gives a name
to a practice that is quite common among functional and F# programmers (and
we have been <a href="http://functional-programming.net/courses/">teaching it at our F# trainings</a> for the last year)...</p>

<p>Similarly to the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-autumn-2011.aspx">last year</a>,
  I already have a number of F# events planned for the end of the summer and autumn that 
  I'd like to invite you to!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/08/VS2012-Live">Visual Studio 2012 has been completed</a>
  recently and it comes with F# 3.0. For me, this means two things. Firstly, it is the second
  Visual Studio version of F#, which means that functional programming is worth taking seriously.
  Secondly, F# 3.0 comes with <em>type providers</em>, which is a killer feature for working with
  data. No matter if you're a C# programmer now to functional programming or if you're an F#
  user in the real-world, I hope you can find some interesting and useful event below!
</p>

<p>The two main things that I'm going to be involved in are SkilsMatter trainings in London and New York
  and a few events at the biggest functional conference (ICFP) in Copenhagen...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/qcon-async-fsharp.aspx/">Asynchronous client/server in F# (QCon 2012)</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/qcon-async-fsharp/qcon.png" alt="Qcon" class="rdecor" />

<p>Last week, I gave a talk on asynchronous programming in F# at <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012">London QCon 2012</a>.
The talk was a part of <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=560">The Rise of Scala &amp; Functional Programming</a> 
track organized by Charles Humble. Reactive and asynchronous programming was a topic that was repeated
a couple of times during the whole session - Sadek Drobi talked about <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentation/Non%20blocking,%20composable%20reactive%20web%20programming%20with%20Iteratees%20in%20Play2">non-blocking reactive web framework
Play2</a>
and Damien Katz talked about <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentation/Erlang%20in%20the%20real%20world:%20CouchDB">Erlang and CouchDB</a>.</p>

<p>I used the one hour slot to implement "Rectangle Drawing App" - a simple application that 
shows how to write complete client-server application just using F#. On the
server-side, I used asynchronous workflows to write HTTP server with an F#
agent. On the client-side, I used asynchronous workflows to express user
interface logic and the <a href="http://pitfw.org/">Pit project</a> to run F# code as
JavaScript that works everywhere. The app definitely had a huge commercial potential:</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I posted a list of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-autumn-2011.aspx">
  F# talks and courses for Autumn 2011</a>. Although I tried hard to have <em>fewer</em>
  speaking engagements during the winter and spring, there are quite a few events that
  I'd like to invite you to.
</p>

<p>Last year, I spent quite a lot of time talking about asynchronous programming
  and agents. I think this is still a very important topic and especially agent-based programming
  in F# is a powerful way to implement concurrency primitives (like blocking queue), as well as 
  complex systems (like <a href="http://www.trayport.com/en/joule/video">trading screens</a>
  and <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/functional-londoners-may-meetup">market analysis</a>).
  I also wrote a series of articles on this topic that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273081.aspx">are
  available on MSDN</a> and should be a good starting point.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, I'll be doing some talks about type providers, which is an upcoming F# 3.0
  technology for accessing data. However, I also hope to find some time to look at other directions for F#,
  especially how it can be used in an online web-based environment, either using Azure or by translating F# to JavaScript 
  using a recently announced <a href="http://pitfw.posterous.com/">open-source project named Pit</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/regions-navigation.aspx/">Regions and navigation bar for F# in Visual Studio</a></h1>
    
<p>The beginning of a new year may be a good time for writing one lightweight blog
  post that I wanted to publish for some time now. During my last internship with the
  F# team at MSR, I did some work on improving the F# IntelliSense in Visual Studio. This
  mostly involved the usual features - automatic completion, colouring and tooltips.
  The F# IntelliSense in Visual Studio 2010 still isn't perfect, but I think it is safe
  to claim that it is the best IDE experience for a typed functional programming language
  (aside, you can vote for some F# IDE features <a href="http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2149735-improve-intellisense-support-for-f-">here</a>
  and <a href="http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2213611-provide-refactoring-support-for-f-code-">here</a>).

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-generic-numeric.aspx/">F# Math (IV.) - Writing generic numeric code</a></h1>
    
<p>Generic numeric code is some calculation that can be used for working with multiple different numeric 
  types including types such as <code>int</code>, <code>decimal</code> and <code>float</code> or even our own 
  numeric types (such as the type for <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx">clock arithmetic 
  from the previous article of the series</a>). Generic numeric code differs from ordinary generic F# code such 
  as the <code>'a list</code> type or <code>List.map</code> function, because <em>numeric code</em> uses numeric operators 
  such as <code>+</code> or <code>&gt;=</code> that are defined differently for each numeric type.</p>

<p>When writing simple generic code that has some type parameter <code>'T</code>, we don’t know anything about 
  the type parameter and there is no way to restrict it to a numeric type that provides all the operators that 
  we may need to use in our code. This is a limitation of the .NET runtime and F# provides two ways for 
  overcoming it.</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Static member constraints</strong> can be used to write generic code where the actual 
    numeric operations are resolved at compile-time (and a generic function is specialized for all required
    numeric types). This approach makes resulting code very efficient and is generally very easy to use
    when writing a function such as <code>List.sum</code>.</li>

  <li><strong>Global numeric associations</strong> (available in F# PowerPack) give us a way to obtain 
    an interface implementing required numeric operations dynamically at runtime. This approach has some 
    runtime overhead, but can be used for complex numeric types (such as <code>Matrix&lt;'T&gt;</code>).</li>

  <li><strong>Combination of both</strong> techniques can be used to implement complex numeric type
    that is generic over the contained numeric values and has only a minimal runtime overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Static member constraints are a unique feature of F# that is not available in other .NET
  languages, so if you're interested in writing numeric code for .NET,
  this may be a good reason for choosing F#. In C# or Visual Basic, you would be limited to the 
  second option (which can be implemented in C#). In dynamic languages (like IronPython), everything
  is dynamic, so numeric computations can work with any numeric type, but will be significantly
  less efficient. In the rest of the article, we look at the three options summarized above.

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx/">F# Math (III.) - Defining custom numeric types</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article, we define an F# numeric type for calculating in the modular arithmetic (also called clock arithmetic)
  [<a href="#ppcnuml">1</a>].  
  Modular arithmetic is used for calculations where we want to keep a value within a specified range by counting in cycles. 
  For example, a maximal value on clock is 12 hours. When we add 11 hours and 3 hours, the value overflows and the result is 
  2 hours. Aside from clocks, this numeric system is also essential in cryptography or, for example, in music.</p>

<p>This tutorial shows several techniques that are essential when defining any new numeric type in F#. Most importantly, you’ll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a numeric type with overloaded operators </li>
<li>Define a numeric literal for constructing numbers of our new type</li>
<li>Enable calculating with our type in F# lists and matrices</li>
<li>Hide implementation details of a numeric type</li>
</ul>

<p>We define type <code>IntegerZ5</code> that implements modular arithmetic with modulus 5, meaning that valid values are in the range 
  from 0 to 4 and we equip the type with operations such as addition and multiplication. When an operation produces a value that would 
  be outside of the range, we adjust it by adding or subtracting the modulus (in our case 5). Here are some examples of calculations 
  that we’ll be able to write:</p>
<pre>
2 + 1 = 3 (mod 5)
4 * 2 = 3 (mod 5)
List.sum [ 0; 1; 2; 3 ] = 1 (mod 5)
</pre>

<p>In the first case, we can perform the operation without any adjustments. In the second case, we multiply 4 by 2 and get 8 as the 
  result, which is out of the required range. To correct it, we calculate the remainder after a division by 5 (written as <code>8 % 5</code> in F#), 
  which gives us 3. Finally, the last example shows that we’d also like to be able to use our type with lists. If we add values 0, 1, 2
  and 3, we get 6 which is adjusted to 1.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-matrix.aspx/">F# Math (II.) - Using matrices for graph algorithms</a></h1>
    
<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-numeric.aspx">previous article of this 
  series</a>, we looked at <code>complex</code> and <code>BigRational</code>, which are two 
  numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. Aside from these two, the PowerPack 
  library also contains a type <code>matrix</code> representing a two-dimensional matrix
  of floating-point values.</p>

<p>In this article, you'll learn how to work with matrices in F#, using some 
  of the functions provided by F# PowerPack. I'll demonstrate the library using an 
  example that represents <em>graphs</em> using a, so called, <em>adjacency matrix</em>.
  If you're not familiar with this concept, you don't need to worry. It is quite simple
  and it will be clear once we look at an example.
  The matrix represents which vertices of a graph are connected with other vertices by 
  an edge. Many of the standard operations on matrices are useful when working with 
  adjacency matrix, so this tutorial will cover the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating matrices from lists and using functions from the <code>Matrix</code> module</li>
  <li>Using slices to read or modify a part of matrix</li>
  <li>Performing standard operations with matrices such as transposition and matrix multiplication</li>
  <li>Using higher order functions for working with matrices</li>
</ul>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-numeric.aspx/">F# Math (I.) - Numeric types in PowerPack</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article, we'll briefly look at two numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. 
  The type <code>complex</code> represents complex numbers consisting of real and imaginary parts. 
  Both parts are stored as a floating point numbers. The type <code>BigRational</code> represents 
  rational numbers consisting of numerator and denominator of arbitrary sizes. Integers of arbitrary
  size are represented using <code>BigInteger</code> type that is available in .NET 4.0 
  (in the <code>System.Numerics.dll</code> assembly). On .NET 2.0, the <code>BigInteger</code>
  type is also a part of F# PowerPack.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/powerpack-series/z5snip.png" style="float:right;margin:0px 0px 5px 15px" />
<p>This article is the first article of a series where I'll explain some of the
  F# features that are useful for numeric computing as well as some functionality from 
  the F# PowerPack library. Most of the content was originally written for 
  the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273075.aspx">Numerical Computing in F#</a> chapter on MSDN (that I 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/real-world-book-msdn.aspx">announced earlier</a>), 
  but then we decided to focus on using F# with third party libraries that provide more
  efficient implementation and richer set of standard numeric functionality that's 
  needed when implementing machine learning and probabilistic algorithms or performing 
  statistical analysis. If you're interested in these topics, then the last section 
  (below) gives links to the important MSDN articles.</p>

<p>However, F# PowerPack still contains some useful functionality. It includes two
  additional numeric types and an implementation of matrix that integrates nicely
  with F#. The series also demonstrates how to use features of the F# language 
  (and core libraries) to write numeric code elegantly. In particular, we'll use the
  following aspects:</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Overloaded operators.</strong> Any type can provide overloaded version of standard numeric 
    operators such as +, -, * and / as well as other non-standard operators (such as .*). 
    As a result, libraries can implement their own numeric types which are 
    indistinguishable from built-in types such as int.</li>

  <li><strong>Numeric literals.</strong> F# math libraries can enable using new numeric literals in the code. For example, you can 
    write a <code>BigRational</code> value representing one third as <code>1N/3N</code>. The <code>N</code> suffix used in the 
    notation is not hardcoded in the F# language and we'll see how to define similar 
    numeric type.</li>

  <li><strong>Static constraints.</strong> F# supports static member constraints, which can be used for writing functions that 
    work with any numeric type. For example, the <code>List.sum</code> function uses this feature. It 
    can sum elements of any list containing numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are just a few of the F# language features that are useful when writing numeric code, but
there are many others. The usual F# development style using interactive tools, type safety that
prevents common errors, units of measure as well the expressivity of F# make it a great tool for
writing numeric code. For more information, take a look at the MSDN overview article 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh304366.aspx">Writing Succinct and Correct Numerical Computations with F#</a>.

<p>The end of the summer holiday season is getting closer. Luckily, I was in Prague last
week so I actually noticed there was summer this year!</p>

<p>After a few quiet months, the autumn is going to be quite busy.
  Microsoft's <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">//build/</a>
  conference will reveal the future of software development for Windows,
  but great things are going on in the F# world too. Don Syme is going to talk about 
  <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/fsharp3">F# Information Rich Programming</a>
  at Progressive F# Tutorials in November, which should reveal more about F# 3.0 and type providers!</p>

<p>I have quite a few speaking engagements planned already, so
  if you want to learn about functional programming in .NET (and become a better
  C# programmer) or about F# and asynchronous programming,
  here are a few events that you may be interested in...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-sequences.aspx/">Programming with F# asynchronous sequences</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/async-sequences/decor.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>In F#, we can represent asynchronous operations that do not block threads and eventually
  return a value of type <code>'T</code> using asynchronous workflows <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code>.
  Asynchronous workflows can be easily constructed using the computation expression syntax
  <code>async { ... }</code> and there are also a few combi&#173;nators that express more advanced
  composition (such as parallel composition or fork-join parallelism).</p>

<p>Sometimes, we need to use asynchronous operations that return more than just one value.
  For example, when downloading data from the internet, we would like to create an 
  <em>asynchronous sequence</em> that returns the data in chunks as they become available.</p>

<p>One way to represent asynchronous operations that produce multiple values is to use 
  the <code>IObservable&lt;'T&gt;</code> type from .NET. This isn't always the best option 
  though. Observables implement <em>push-based</em> model, which means that chunks of data are
  generated as quickly as possible (until all chunks are emitted). What if we wanted to take 
  the chunks one-by-one after the previous chunk is processed?</p>

<p>In this article, I describe <em>asynchronous sequences</em>. An asynchronous sequence is a simple,
  yet very powerful concept based on asynchronous workflows. It follows the same core model: results 
  are generated on demand and asynchronously. Unlike asynchronous workflows, asynchronous sequences
  can be called (on demand) to generate multiple values until the end of the sequence is reached.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">I first discussed asynchronous sequences with Don Syme, Dmitry Lomov and Brian McNamara in an
  email thread a long time ago. Thanks to Don for enthusiasm about the concept and for the 
  first implementation of some of the combinators!</p>

<p>More than a year ago, Mike Stephens from <a href="http://manning.com">Manning</a> (who
 was also behind my <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>

 was to collaborate with Microsoft on creating some additional content for the official
 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd233154(VS.100).aspx">F# Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the new content appeared on MSDN, so I finally have an excuse for the
  recent lack of blogging! Although the content contains a large number of new articles
  that are not based on my book, you can find it in the MSDN section named after my

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/safe-gui-async.aspx/">Safer asynchronous workflows for GUI programming</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/safe-gui-async/screen.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 15px;" />

<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-non-blocking-gui.aspx">previous article</a>,
  I discussed how to use F# asynchronous work&#173;flows for creating reactive user-interfaces.
  One of the main concerns was to avoid blocking the GUI thread (to prevent the user-interface
  from freezing). The workflow shouldn't perform any CPU-intensive compu&#173;tation when running
  on the GUI thread.</p>

<p>The standard F# library provides two ways to run a computation on a background thread from
  an asynchronous workflow. The <code>StartChild</code> operation starts an operation 
  in the thread pool and returns a workflow that can be called using asynchronous (non-blocking)
  <code>let!</code> construct. The <code>SwitchToThreadPool</code> operation can be called
  using <code>do!</code> and resumes the rest of the workflow on a background thread.</p>

<p>When using the <code>SwitchToThreadPool</code> operation, we also need to eventually use
  <code>SwitchToContext</code> to transfer the execution back to the GUI thread (after 
  completing the CPU-intensive calculations). In this article, I describe a variation of 
  F# asynchronous workflows that keeps track of the running thread in the type of the 
  computation. As a result, calling a workflow that should be executed on a GUI thread 
  from a background thread is a compile-time error as opposed to failing at runtime.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/async-non-blocking-calls/screen.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 15px;" />

<p>F# asynchronous workflows are best known as a way to write efficient I/O operations
  or as an underlying mechanism of F# agent-based programming (using the <code>MailboxProcessor</code>
  type). However, they are also very useful for user-interface programming. I think this is 
  a very interesting and important area, so I already wrote and talked about this topic - 
  it is covered in <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/">Chapter 16 of my book</a> (there
  is a <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx">free excerpt</a>)
  and I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx">talked about it</a> at F#unctional Londoners
  meeting.</p>

<p>Many applications combine user-interface programming (such as waiting for an event asynchronously)
  with some CPU-intensive tasks. This article looks at an example of such application and I'll explain 
  how to avoid blocking the user-interface when doing the CPU-intensive task. 
  The article starts with an example that is wrong and blocks the user-interface when doing data processing.
  Then I'll show you two options for fixing the problem. The three most important
  functions from the standard F# library that I'll discuss are <code>Async.StartChild</code> and 
  <code>Async.SwitchTo&#173;ThreadPool</code> with <code>Async.SwitchToContext</code>.</p>

<p>This is the first article of a mini-series. In the next article, I'll demonstrate a simple
  wrapper for F# <code>async</code> that makes it more difficult to write <em>wrong</em> 
  programs. The wrapper keeps the desired thread (GUI or background) in the type of the 
  computations and code that would block the user interface will not type-check. But first,
  let's look at the example...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx/">Beyond the Monad fashion (I.): Writing idioms in LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>Thanks to LINQ and Erik Meier, monads have become a fashionable topic in the C# developer community.
  Indeed, no serious developer conference on .NET can get away without having a talk on monads. The attractive
  thing about LINQ and monads is that the <code>SelectMany</code> operator roughly corresponds to the <em>bind</em>
  function that defines a monad. In practice, LINQ is used for working with collections of data (<code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>),
  but you can also define <em>bind</em> (i.e. <code>SelectMany</code>) for some other data types and use the LINQ syntax
  for working with other types. You won't be really using the full LINQ syntax. You'll probably use just nested
  <code>from</code> clauses (for <em>binding</em>) and <code>select</code> at the end to return the result.</p>

<p>However, monads are not the only notion of computation that we can work with. More interestingly, they are also 
  not the only notion of computation that you can encode using LINQ! In this article, I'll briefly introduce 
  <em>idioms</em> (also called <em>applicative functors</em>), which is another useful abstract type of computations.
  Idioms can be used for a few things that cannot be done using monads.</p>

<p>A provocative summary of this article is: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">"Everyone who tells you that LINQ is a monad is wrong!"</span></p>

<p>The truth is
that LINQ syntax can be used for encoding <em>queries</em> (obviously), <em>monads</em> (as you were told), but also for <em>idioms</em> as you'll learn today (and quite possibly for other types of computations). In this article, we look at a basic example, but I'll describe a more complex real-world scenario in the next blog post.</p>

<p>It appears that I have been doing a lot more talking than writing in the last two months.
  I'm hoping to change this direction and I have two articles almost ready, so stay tuned!
  I was also posting all my interesting F# snippets to <a href="http://fssnip.net/authors/Tomas+Petricek">fssnip.net</a>,
  which has grown quite a bit since I announced it in the last blog post. Thanks to everybody
  who submitted their snippets already and I'm looking forward to more! By the way, you can
  now run snippets using <a href="http://tryfs.net/">tryfs.net</a> by clicking at 
  "Load in TryF#" button.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the queue with talk materials that I wanted to post on my blog 
  has grown to 3. I talked about F# in MonoDevelop in the <a href="http://weblog.savanne.be/376-fosdem-2011-mono-room-slides">Mono room at FOSDEM</a> in February, 
  then I did an online talk for the <a href="http://www.communityforfsharp.net/">Community for F# </a>.
  Finally, this week, I did a tutorial on F# with <a href="http://www.trelford.com/blog/">Phil Trelford</a>
  at QCon in London (to fill in for Michael Stal due to unexpected health reasons).</p>

<p>Before I move on to writing about my recent experiments with LINQ, you can find materials from
  all of the recent talks below... </p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/education-and-agents-talk/castle.jpg" class="rdecor" />

<p>November was quite a busy month for me. First, I traveled to Cambridge (the "new one" in
  Massachusetts :-)) to present my work on the F# plugin for MonoDevelop at the F# in Education workshop.
  Shortly after getting back to London, I started working on a presentation about Concurrent Programming
  with Agents at the F#unctional Londoners meeting. </p>

<p>Now that both of the events are over, I'd like to write a short summary and also finally
  publish my slides and demos. In addition, both of the events were recorded (thanks to External 
  Research group at MSR and SkillsMatter), so if you missed them, you can watch the recording...</p>

<p>Both of the events were really great and I had a chance to meet quite a few interesting people. 
  One of the things that make F# great is the community around it. I think that one unique aspect of the
  F# community is its diversity. The same language is appealing to high school teachers, academics and 
  researchers as well as software developers and technical directors from the industry. This combination
  is really valuable for both sides. It helps to transfer ideas from research to practice it 
  gives researchers clear picture of problems in the industry that deserve their attention.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-compilation-internals.aspx/">Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</a></h1>
    
<p>Some time ago, I started writing a series about the differences between the asynchronous model in F# 
  (in Visual Studio 2010) and the asynchronous language extensions for C# proposed at PDC 2010.
  In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">first article</a>, I showed
  how both of the language features look and I highlighted a couple of differences. In the
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">second article</a>, I discussed
  the support for cancellation (available only in F#) and how the two models differ 
  <em>semantically</em> (i.e. what are differences in the behaviour). However, I didn't talk about more
  techincal differences and, in particular, how is the asynchronous code compiled. We'll look 
  at this topic today...</p>

<p>Although the C# asynchronous programming model is very similar to F# asynchronous workflows,
  the compilation looks quite different. The C# compiler uses a similar technique as when compiling
  iterators and creates a state machine, while the F# compiler uses an approach based on higher order
  functions (combinators) that's shared with (most) other computation expressions.</p>

<p>I won't discuss the syntax of F# asynchronous workflows or the C# asynchronous extensions in 
  this article, so if you're new to one of these, here are links to other articles in this 
  series: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (I.): Simultaneous introduction</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (II.): How do they differ?</a></li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</strong></li>
  <li>Asynchronous C# and F# (IV.): Calling F# libraries from C# <em>(not yet available)</em></li>
</ul>  

<p>Let's start by looking at the mechanism used in the C# compiler. If you already know how
  iterators work in C# 2.0, then you'll find it quite easy to understand. If you're not familiar
  with iterators, then don't worry - I'll make the explanation self-contained.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-adash-cancellation.aspx/">F# Parallel Extras (III.): Financial dashboard with cancellation</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article we'll look at several improvements that can be done to the Financial dashboard example
  (originally from the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a> book).
  When I was translating samples in the book from C# to F#, the sample struck me, because it looks like
  a perfect fit for F# asynchronous workflows (instead of the <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> type used in the
  C# version). I already talked about an <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-adash.aspx">alternative 
  implementation</a> based on asynchronous workflows. However that version was still following some of the
  programming patterns, from the original C# version, which are not idiomatic in F#. In this article, I'll talk
  about a few other improvements that we can make to the sample...</p>

<p>In the original version of the sample (in both C# and F#), we explicitly checked whether a cancellation
  token has been cancelled in every single operation. This was needed in C#, because tasks do not support
  cancellation automatically. However, F# asynchronous workflows make cancellation easier. They automatically
  check if the computation should be cancelled at the beginning and the end of every asynchronous call. Our
  first change will be to use this feature. Also, the original version propagates a <code>null</code> value
  when the computation is cancelling. In F# we don't need that and we'll only change the type of the overall
  result to <code>option&lt;T&gt;</code>, so that we can notify the user interface (but we don't need to 
  propagate cancellation explicitly). Finally, the original version contained sequential implementation, but
  didn't provide any way of actually running it, so we'll do a bit of refactoring to make that sample 
  actually useable.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-blockingagent.aspx/">F# Parallel Extras (II.): Agent-based blocking queue</a></h1>
    
<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-image-pipeline.aspx">previous article</a>, we 
  briefly introduced the <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> type and we used it to implement the
  pipeline pattern (from Chapter 7 of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>)
  using asynchronous workflows. The type was used to represent intermediate buffers with a limited size.
  In this article we'll take a look at the implementation of the type. The type implements a very useful
  pattern in agent-based parallel programming, so you can use it in your work, but it could be also 
  interesting as a demonstration of the F# <code>Agent&lt;T&gt;</code> type (an recommended alias 
  for the <code>MailboxProcessor&lt;T&gt;</code> type).</p>
<p>The <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> type is similar to <code>BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> 
  from .NET 4.0. It has methods for adding and removing elements that block when the operation cannot be
  done (e.g. adding when the queue is full or removing when the queue is empty). The most important 
  difference is that it can be used <em>asynchronously</em>. This means that when we call its operations
  form F# asynchronous workflow (using <code>let!</code> and <code>do!</code>), the operation will block
  the calling workflow, but it will not block any physical thread. We start by looking at the overall
  structure of the agent and then look at the body of the agent which implements its behavior (using
  a state machine)...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-image-pipeline.aspx/">F# Parallel Extras (I.): Image pipeline using agents</a></h1>
    
<p>In a <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-samples.aspx">recent blog post series</a>,
  I wrote about parallel programming samples that accompany the 
  <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>
  book by patterns &amp; practices group at Microsoft. The F# translation of the samples that I
  wrote about mostly followed the style used in the book, so it used patterns that 
  are typical for C#. However, some of the samples can be written in F# in a more interesting way...</p>
<p>In this article, we'll take a look at agent-based implementation of the Image pipeline 
  example (from chapter 7). A <em>pipeline</em> is a useful pattern if you need to process large
  number of inputs in parallel and the processing consists of multiple phases or steps. In the
  original implementation, the pipeline was implemented using <code>BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>
  and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> types from .NET 4.0.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll show a 
  version that uses F# agents and asynchronous workflows. We'll use a <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> 
  type, which is <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-blockingagent.aspx">discussed in another 
  article</a>. It represents a queue with limited capacity that asynchronously blocks the process that is adding 
  values if there is no space in the buffer and blocks the process that reads values when there are no 
  values. This type can be elegantly used to implement the pipeline pattern. In this article, we'll 
  demonstrate it by writing a four-phase pipeline that processes images. As you'll see, 
  the agent-based version of the code is very much easier to write and has similar performance as 
  the original version.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/fswebsnippets/logo-sm.png" style="float:right;margin:10px 5px 10px 10px" />

<p>Languages with type-inference make it possible to write shorter code, because a smart
  compiler infers the types automatically. Even though we don't write the types, they are
  still there and are used to check whether our code doesn't contain (certain type of) bugs.
  However, types are not only useful for safety, but also when understanding code. When you 
  see a function together with its type (especially higher-order functions) you can understand
  code much more easily than when you just see its name.
  When writing F# code, you can see all the types thanks to great integration for Visual Studio.
  However, what if you post a code sample to a web site or a blog? Many F# code snippets (including
  some on this blog) are just difficult to read without types. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was talking with James Margetson (from the F# team) about the possible uses
  of some functionality provided by the F# compiler and he suggested that we could use them
  to solve the problem I described in the introduction. Wouldn't it be nice if you could place a 
  mouse cursor over an identifier in an F# blog post and see the same type information as the 
  one that would appear in Visual Studio? </p>

<p>Here is an example of what I'm talking about: </p>

<p>If you cannot wait and want to create F# source code snippets like this yourself, then 
  go straight to <a href="http://tomasp.net/fswebsnippets">F# Web Snippets</a> (please use the
  web based version carefully - processing is pretty demanding!). If you first want to know how
  it works and how to use it, as well as where to get the source code, then continue reading...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-adash.aspx/">Parallel Programming in F# (IV.): Financial dashboard example</a></h1>
    
<p>In the fourth part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll take a look at the Adatum Financial 
  Dashboard sample. The sample is a part of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>, which is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide, but the F# translation
  contains several additional interesting aspects that I'll introduce in this article.</p>

<p>The sample simulates a financial modelling application that performs processing of market
  data in several steps that can be partly executed in parallel. In this article we'll compare two
  implementations. The first one (similar to the C# version) uses the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type 
  from .NET 4.0 and chains steps using the <code>ContinueWith</code> method. The second version is 
  F# specific and it implements step as a sequential computation wrapped in asynchronous 
  workflows. Partial results are reported to the user interface using events.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-aggregate.aspx/">Parallel Programming in F# (III.): Aggregating data</a></h1>
    
<p>In this part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll explore examples of parallel aggregation 
  from Chapter 4 of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>, which is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide. In this article,
  we'll look at the F# translation and in particular at several functions from the <code>PSeq</code>
  module. Some of the functionality is currently available only in the "PSeq.fs" distributed with the
  samples, but will eventually appear in F# PowerPack as well. </p>

<p>Aggregation of data in parallel is an interesting problem. As we've seen in the previous article, 
  PLINQ and tasks make it easy to parallelize independent blocks of code that don't share any state.
  Unfortunatelly, not all programs are like that. In particular, we often need to aggregate all
  elements of a sequence - when writing sequential code in F#, you would use the <code>Seq.fold</code>
  function. In this article, we'll look at functions that implement fold parallel.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-plinq.aspx/">Parallel Programming in F# (II.): Using PLINQ and Tasks</a></h1>
    
<p>In this part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll look at some basic examples of parallel 
  programming in F# that are available in <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>. This is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The guide discusses the samples in C#, but it also contains an F# translation of the source
  code. Since the languages are different, the F# version deserves a brief explanation.</p>
  
<p>In this article, we'll discuss some of the F# examples and we'll look at a couple of aspects that
  are specific for F#. In particular, we'll look at working with Parallel LINQ (both directly and using
  <code>PSeq</code> module from F# PowerPack) and working with tasks. We'll also look at an interesting 
  example (using closures) where C# version doesn't behave as expected, but a literal translation in F# corrects the 
  problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a> is a 
  guide written by the patterns &amp; practices group at Microsoft. It introduces .NET programmers to
  patterns for including parallelism in their applications (using support for parallel programming in
  .NET 4.0). It introduces techniques such as parallel loops, parallel tasks, data aggregation and so on.
  The book includes numerous samples in C# and Visual Basic that can be easily copied and adapted 
  to match your needs.</p>

<p>As part of a contracting work for the F# team, I developed an F# version of the samples, which is 
  now available on the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">book web site</a>.
  You can get it by downloading <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/releases/view/50473">F# code samples</a> (ZIP) from the 1.0 release, or you can download the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets" 
  type="external">latest version of the source code</a> directly. The F# version of the
  code is mostly a direct translation of the C# versions, but there are a few interesting places that
  are worth discussing. In particular, some of the samples use the <code>PSeq</code> module from F#
  PowerPack and I also added a version of one example that uses F# asynchronous workflows.</p>

<p>In this article series, I'll look at several interesting examples from the F# version of the source code.
  We'll look how to use PLINQ and Tasks (which are available in .NET 4.0) from F# (Part II.) including some advanced topics such 
  as the Map-Reduce algorithm (Part III.). We'll also look at a larger example built using tasks and an alternative 
  implementation using asynchronous workflows (Part IV.) Here are links to the individual articles:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-sql.aspx/">Dynamic in F#: Reading data from SQL database</a></h1>
    
<p>When reading data from a SQL database in F#, you have a couple of options.
  You can use F# implementation of LINQ, which allows you to write queries directly
  in the F# language or you can use standard ADO.NET classes such as <code>SqlCommand</code>.
  The second option is often good enough - when you just need to call a simple 
  query, you probably don't want to setup the whole LINQ infrastructure (generate
  classes, reference F# PowerPack, etc.) Unfortunately, ADO.NET classes are a bit
  ugly to use. When calling an SQL stored procedure, you need to specify the name
  of the procedure as a string, you need to add parameters one-by-one by creating
  instances of <code>SqlParameter</code>, you need to dynamically cast results from 
  the <code>obj</code> type and so on...</p>

<p>In this article, we'll look how to use the <em>dynamic operator</em> to make the
  experience of using ADO.NET from F# dramatically better. Dynamic operator (there are
  actually two of them) are a simple way of supporting dynamic invoke in F#. We can use
  it to write code that looks almost like an ordinary method call or property access,
  but is resolved dynamically at runtime (using the name of the method or property).
  The following example shows what we'll be able to write at the end 
  of this article:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// Call 'GetProducts' procedure with 'CategoryID' set to 1
use conn = new DynamicSqlConnection(connectionString)
use cmd = conn?GetProducts
cmd?CategoryID &lt;- 1
conn.Open()

// Read all products and print their names
use reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
while reader.Read() do
  printfn "Product: %s" reader?ProductName
</pre>

<p>If you ever tried to call a SQL stored procedure directly using the 
  <code>SqlCommand</code>, then you can surely appreciate the elegance of this code
  snippet. Let's now take a look at a larger example and some of the neat 
  tricks that make this possible...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx/">Recording and samples from my Reactive F# talk</a></h1>
    
<p>Almost a week ago, I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fun-londoners-reactive.aspx">posted an invitation</a> to my 
  F# talk at the F#unctional Londoners user group. The theme of my talk was <em>reactive programming</em>, which 
  was also a topic of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/reactive-thesis.aspx">Master's thesis</a> (defended
  earlier in June), so I really enjoyed talking about it. In the talk, I discussed the two approaches that you can 
  use for developing reactive applications in F# (using examples in Silverlight):

</a>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Declarative</strong> (or <em>data-flow</em> oriented) allows you to describe "what" should be 
    done with data that your component receives from various events (such as mouse position etc.) This can 
    be written using F# event combinators such as <code>Event.map</code> and <code>Event.scan</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Imperative</strong> (or <em>control-flow</em> oriented) - in this style, we describe various
    states of the component (e.g. semaphore with green, orange and red) and describe transitions between the
    states. This can be written using F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and the <code>AwaitObservable</code>
    primitive (which you can get as part of the source code).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to the folks from <a href="http://skillsmatter.com">SkillsMatter</a> who provided place for the meetup
  and helped with the organization, the talk was also recorded and is already available online! Below, you can also 
  get all the nice Silverlight demos that I used during the talk...</p>

<h2>Reactive Programming with F#</h2>
<p>I'm sure you're already convinced to come. Nevertheless, you may still want to know 
  what I'm going to talk about. There are many areas where F# offers clear benefits such as
  parallel &amp; concurrent programming. I believe that <strong>reactive programming</strong>
  is another great area for F#. In reactive programming, we face quite different problems than
  in other programming styles. We (as the authors of the application) can no longer specify what
  the application should do. Instead, the application needs to be able to handle many possible
  combinations of events. This aspect of programming is sometimes called <em>inversion of control</em>.</p>
<p>Reactive programming is important for programming user interfaces, especially today when
  user interfaces are becoming more interactive and more "fancy". To demonstrate this, I'm working on some nice <strong>Silverlight</strong> demos for the talk! However, it is also needed
  to handle other kinds of events such as completion of background task or message from 
  other application. We'll look at the two essential techniques that F# provides for reactive
  programming:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Declarative event combinators</strong> - one way of writing reactive applications
    is to specify the whole event processing declaratively by saying "what" should be done with 
    occurrences of events. This is particularly useful when we need to encode simpler
    logic with a clear <em>data-flow</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Imperative using workflows</strong> - for more complicated interactions, we can
    use <em>asynchronous workflows</em>. This makes the code more explicit, but we get full 
    control over the <em>control-flow</em> of the application. Even though this approach is 
    more "imperative" it can be used for writing nicely composable functional code as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing you at the talk next week!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-mvc-web.aspx/">ASP.NET and F# (I.) - Creating MVC web applications in F#</a></h1>
    
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a couple of examples of <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-in-fsharp.aspx">
  developing web applications in F# using ASP.NET</a>. Since then, the F# language and runtime has changed
  a little bit and there are also new technologies available in ASP.NET, so I thought I'd write a more
  up-to-date article on this topic. In this article, I'll present a simple "demo" F# web application that
  you can use as a starting point when creating your own projects (you'll also find a convenient Visual
  Studio 2010 template below). The article shows the following interesting things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong> - We're going to use ASP.NET MVC Framework to create the web
    application. As the article name suggests, most of the actual program code including models and
    controllers will be implemented in F#.</li>
  <li><strong>F# LINQ to SQL</strong> - The application uses a sample Northwind database and we'll
    write queries for selecting data from the database using LINQ support that's available in the
    <a href="http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/" type="external">F# PowerPack</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>F# features</strong> - The application also uses some nice F# features that are 
    quite useful for developing web applications. We'll use modules and records to implement the
    model and we'll also use advanced meta-programming features for constructing LINQ queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use F# for creating an MVC application, you have a few options. It should be 
  possible to create the web application solely as an F# project. However, we'll use a more convenient
  approach. We'll create a standard C# MVC project and move all the actual implementation to 
  an F# library. We'll look at the application structure shortly. The following screenshot shows
  a page that lists products in the Northwind database:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/excerpt-gui-workflows.aspx/">Programming user interfaces using F# workflows</a></h1>
    
<p>Numerous Manning partners already published several exceprts from my <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/" target="external">Real-World Functional Programming</a> book. You can find a list on the <a href="http://functional-programming.net/" type="external">book's web page</a>. However, the last excerpt published <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx" type="external">at DotNetSlackers</a> is particularly interesting. It discusses how to use F# asynchronous workflows to write GUI applications. This is a very powerful programming pattern that is very difficult to do in any other .NET language. We first discussed it with Don Syme during my internship at Microsoft Research and I found it very elegant, so I made some space for it in the book. In fact, the entire Chapter 16 discusses various reactive programming techniques that can be used in F#.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/excerpt-gui-workflows/app.png" style="margin:15px;float:right;" />
<p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">When designing applications that don't react to external events, you have lots of control flow constructs available, such as if-then-else expressions, for loops and while loops in imperative languages, or recursion and higher-order functions in functional languages. Constructs like this make it easy to describe what the application does. The control flow is clearly visible in the source code, so drawing a flowchart to describe it is straightforward.</p>

<p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">Understanding reactive applications is much more difficult. A typical C# application or GUI control that needs to react to multiple events usually involves mutable state. When an event occurs, it updates the state and may run more code in response to the event, depending on the current state. This architecture makes it quite difficult to understand the potential states of the application and the transitions between them. Using asynchronous workflows, we can write the code in a way that makes the control flow of the application visible even for reactive applications.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/book-deal.aspx/">Deal of the day: Real-World Functional Programming</a></h1>
    
<p>Some time ago, I received my copies of <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong>. I started working on it back in May 2008 and as many people who had more experience with writing books told me, it took longer than I was expecting! Anyway, I have to say, it was worth it, holding the actual printed book with my name on the cover is just fantastic!</p>
<br />
<a href="http://manning.com/petricek"><img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/book-deal/book.jpg" style="border:0px; float:right;margin:10px;" /></a>

<p>The goal of the book is to present functional programming concepts and ideas in a readable form. I wanted to create a book that will teach you how to <em>think functionally</em> without using the usual <em>shock therapy</em> that people usually feel when seeing functional programming for the first time. There are already a couple of reviews that suggest I was quite successful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Functional Programming for the Real World, by Tomas Petricek and Jon Skeet, has been a very helpful book for moving to F# from C#, as the authors do a fantastic job of helping to explain the differences between OOP and FP. </em><br />
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Real-World-Examples/dp/1933988924" type="external">James Black at Amazon.com</a>
  </li>
  <li><em>This book isn’t just a simple introduction to programming in F#; it’s an introductory text on functional programming covering the many reasons why it is time for this programming paradigm to finally be accepted by mainstream programmers. And it also contains much more... </em><br />
    <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/clivet/archive/2010/01/03/85227.aspx" type="external">CliveT, Software Engineer at Red Gate Software</a>
  </li>
  <li>... and there are many other great comments about the book at <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Manning book page</a>.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Deal of the day (January 24)</h2>
<p>Finally, here is one great news if you're interested in getting the book! <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong> is Manning's Deal of the Day this Sunday, January 24. On this day, the print book is available for $20 from the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Manning website</a>, with code <code>dotd0124</code>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx/">Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article series, we're talking about the Accelerator project and I'm 
  presenting an F# library that I implemented, which allows you to use Accelerator [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx#accelfsh4links">references</a>]
  in a more sophisticated way. We've seen two examples of using Accelerator directly
  (see also <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">introduction</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">Game of Life</a>).
  In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx">previous article</a>
  I introduced my F# library for working with Accelerator. We've seen F# functions from the
  <code>DataParallel</code> module, we implemented an algorithm that rotates an image
  using these functions and finally, we've seen that we can take this ordinary F# code
  and run it using Accelerator. This is all possible thanks to F# quotations, which 
  we can use to get an AST (a source code) of an F# function we wrote (if the function
  is marked in some special way).</p>
  
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-quotations/blur.png" alt="Blurred photo of Prague" style="float:right; margin:10px" />
<p>In this part of the series, we're going to look at working with quotations explicitly.
  We'll use meta-programming techniques to work with Accelerator. Meta-programming means
  writing programs that manipulate with other programs or pieces of code. This is exactly
  what we're going to do in this article. We'll write an F# function (running on CPU) that
  builds a program, which we'll then run using Accelerator.</p>
<p>This is quite interesting approach, which isn't possible when we call Accelerator
  methods as standard F# functions or .NET methods. The benefit is that we'll 
  clearly see which parts of program run on CPU and what parts execute on GPU or using
  X64 multi-core target. We could also perform more complicated optimizations with 
  the code (because this wouldn't affect the readability). Just for your reference, here is the list
  of articles in this series in case you missed some of them:</p>

</ul>  
<p>However, enough with theory and let's take a look at some code samples! 
  This time, we'll implement blurring of an image (also called convolution). 
  Another example how to write this in F# using Accelerator is Satnam Singh's blog 
  post [<a href="#accelfsh4links">4</a>]. Our example will be different, because we'll
  write the code as standard F# program and then have it translated to Accelerator
  automatically using quotations. We'll also talk about the architecture
  of the library that we're using and look at some performance results.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx/">Accelerator and F# (III.): Data-parallel programs using F# quotations</a></h1>
    
<p>If you've been following this article series, you already know 
  that Accelerator is a MSR library [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx#accelfsh3links">1</a>, <a href="#accelfsh3links">2</a>] 
  that allows you to run code in parallel on either multi-core CPU or using 
  shaders on GPU (see <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">introduction</a>).
  We also discussed a direct way to use Accelerator from F# (by calling Accelerator methods
  directly) and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">implemented Conway's Game of Life</a>.
  In this article, we'll look at more sophisticated way of using Accelerator from F#.
  We'll introduce F# quotations and look at translating 'normal' F# code to use
  Accelerator.</p>
  
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-dataparallel/rotated.png" alt="Rotated Prague photo" style="float:right; margin:10px" />

<p>In general, F# quotations allow us to treat F# code as data structure and manipulate 
  with it. This is very similar to C# expression trees, but the F# implementation is 
  more powerful. We can also mark a standard method or a function with a special attribute
  that tells the compiler to store quotation of the body. Then we can access the
  quotation and traverse it or modify it. In this article we'll use a function that
  takes an F# quotation (containing a limited set of functions) and executes it using
  MSR Accelerator. Implementing this functionality is a bit complicated, so we won't
  discuss the implementation now. We'll leave this for some future article of this series.
  In future, we'll also look at other interesting possibilities that we have when 
  writing code using quotations. Here is a list of articles in this series and of the
  articles that I'm planning to add:</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx/">Accelerator and F# (II.): The Game of Life on GPU</a></h1>
    
<p>In the <a href="accelerator-intro.aspx">previous article</a>, I introduced the
  Microsoft Research Accelerator library. It allows us to write computations with arrays
  in C# and execute them in parallel on multi-core CPU or more interestingly, 
  using GPU shaders. In the previous artcile, we've seen how Accelerator works and 
  how it can be accessed from F#. In this article, we'll look at one more interesting
  F# demo - we'll implement the famous Conway's Game of Life [<a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx#accelfsh2links">1</a>] using Accelerator.
  We'll use a v2 version of Accelerator which has been announced just recently and
  is available from Microsoft Connect [<a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx#accelfsh2links">2</a>].</p>

<p>This article is the second one from a series about using Accelerator from F#. 
  Today, we'll use Accelerator types directly from F# - this is the simplest possible 
  approach and is very similar to the way you'd work with Accelerator in C#. However, 
  we can use some nice F# features such as custom operators to make the code more 
  readable. In the next article, we'll discuss a different approach - we'll look how
  to execute more "standard" F# code (that doesn't reference Accelerator explicitly)
  with Accelerator using F# quotations. The list of articles may change, but here is 
  a list of articles that I'm currently planning to write:</p>

<p>I already wrote about two projects that I worked on during an internship at
  MSR back in 2007 (<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-in-fsharp.aspx" type="external">ASP.NET support in F#</a> and
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebtools-intro.aspx" type="external">F# WebTools</a>).
  Even though this was more than 2 years ago (and I did one more internship at MSR in the meantime),
  I still have one more project that I never published on the web. The folks from the F# team
  reminded me of this project recently, so I thought I could finally publish it. The project 
  used Microsoft Research Accelerator [<a href="#accelfsh1links">1</a>, <a href="#accelfsh1links">2</a>], 
  which is a C# library for developing array-based computations and executing them on a GPU. 
  More recently, the Accelerator team at MSR published Accelerator v2 [<a href="#accelfsh1links">3</a>],
  which was a good motivation to update my original project...</p>
  
<p>In this article, we'll look at the simplest way of using Accelerator from F#. Accelerator
  provides a managed interface that can be naturally used from both C# and F#. We can use
  a mix of method calls and overloaded operators to describe a computation. In F#, we'll also 
  define our additional custom operators to make the code a bit nicer. After we introduce
  Accelerator using a simple C# demo, we'll look how to calculate an approximate value of
  the PI number using a Monte-Carlo method.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/book-completed.aspx/">Real-World Functional Programming: Completed and printed!</a></h1>
    
<p>If you're following my blog or if you're interested in F# or functional programming in .NET, 
  you probably noticed that I was working on a book <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>.
  At some point, we called it <em>Functional Programming for the Real-World</em>, but then we changed the title back
  to a better sounding version <em>Real-World Functional Programming</em> (subtitle <em>With examples
  in F# and C#</em>). The book is also reason for a lower number of blog posts over the last year. Over the last 
  month or so, we were doing the final edits, reviewing the final PDF version (I fixed quite a lot minor 
  issues, synchronized book with the Beta 2 F# release and so on). Anyway, before a few days, I received the following 
  email (as an author, I receive the same emails as those who ordered the book through the <a href="http://www.manning.com/about/meap.html">Manning 
  Early Access Program</a>, so that I can see what we're sending to our dear readers):</p>

<table><tr><td>
<img style="margin:10px" src="/articles/book-completed/cover.png" />
</td><td>
<p style="font-style:italic; margin:10px 30px 10px 10px; text-indent:0px;">
Dear Tomas Petricek, <br />
We are pleased to announce that <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong> is now complete! As a MEAP subscriber 
you can download your copy of the finished ebook right now! (...) This ebook is the final version, 
identical to the softbound edition, which is currently being printed and will be available on <strong>December 24</strong>. 
If you chose the printed book option when you originally subscribed, we'll ship it to you automatically—no action required 
from you. </p>
</td></tr></table>

<h2>Finally finished!</h2>
<p>Yes, that's right. The book is finally completed and as far as I know, it has been printed last week! If you already 
  ordered the book, you won't receive it before Christmas, but it should come shortly after. I can't wait to see the
  book actually <em>printed</em>. The transition from the Word drafts I initially wrote to a final PDF version
  was already felt fantastic and I thought <em>"It looks like a real book!"</em> Among other things, there are now 
  graphical arrows with comments inside listings, which looks really great and makes code listings much easier to read.
  Now I can look forward to seeing the <em>actual book</em>. Maybe I'm too conservative, but I have to say that I'm 
  really glad that I wrote the book before everything is going to be published just electronically!</p>

<p>Here is a couple of links that you may found interesting if you want to look inside the book...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-webcast-objects.aspx/">F# Webcast (IV.) - Developing standard .NET libraries</a></h1>
    
<p>In the previous parts of this webcast series we've developed an F# script that downloads RSS feeds
  asynchronously and in parallel and searches them for the specified keywords. We followed the usual F#
  development style, so after introducing <a href="fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">the basic functional 
  concepts</a>, we wrote the code in <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the simples possible style</a> 
  and demonstrated how to use <code>System.Xml</code> and <code>System.Net</code> namespaces. Then we 
  <a href="fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">refactored the existing code</a>, to run asynchronously and process
  the results potentially in parallel, which was very easy thanks to F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em>.</p>

<p>In this part of the series, we'll make the next evolutionary step of our sample application. We'll turn
  the code that originally used F# tuples and lists into code that uses standard .NET objects and we'll
  also see how to declare a class in F#. This simple modification will turn the script into an F# library
  that is almost indistinguishable from a library developed in C#. We'll also look how you can use the library
  from C# web application to show the interop between C# and F# in practice. We'll start
  with the code from the <a href="fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">previous part</a>, so if you missed that, you
  may want to check it out or download the source code.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-webcast-async.aspx/">F# Webcast (III.) - Using Asynchronous Workflows</a></h1>
    
<p>In this webcast, we'll look at improving the code for downloading and
  processing RSS feeds that I presented in <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the second part</a> 
  (if you didn't see earlier parts, <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the first one</a> was an introduction to 
  basic functional ideas). The previous part demonstrated how to use .NET libraries
  and we implemented a simple <code>downloadUrl</code> function for obtaining content
  of from the web and we've also seen how to load the data into an XML document object
  and how to filter items. In this part, we'll modify the code to run asynchronously and 
  potentially in parallel. To use some of the functionality, you'll need to get 
  <code>FSharp.PowerPack.dll</code>, which is available with the VS 2008 installation or
  as a separated download for VS 2010 [<a href="#fswc_asy">4</a>].
</p>

<p>Now that we have the first version of the code, we can start <em>refactoring</em> it.
  I'm using the term in a slightly vague meaning - we're of course going to change the
  behavior of the code. We'll wrap it into F# <em>asynchronous workflow</em> to run
  without blocking threads and we'll also run multiple downloads in parallel. However,
  this can still be viewed as refactoring in some sense, because we're not changing
  the <em>core</em> behavior of the code. As you can see from the webcast, these kinds of
  refactorings are also very nicely supported by F# syntax...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx/">F# Webcast (II.) - Using .NET libraries</a></h1>
    
<p>About a week ago I posted <a href="fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">the first part</a> of my F# webcast series.
  It focused on explainining the basic ideas behind functional programming such as immutability, recursion
  and passing functions as arguments to other functions (or methods in C#). In the first part, we've seen some
  C# code to demonstrate the ideas and also a bit of F#, mainly to show the basic language features.
</p>

<p>The second part is going to be exclusively about F#. It'll demonstrate how we can start writing
  a demo application that grabs data from RSS feeds and processes them. You'll learn how to access
  .NET libraries from F# (in particular, we'll use <code>System.Net</code> and <code>System.Xml</code>).
  We'll develop the code iteratively, which means that we'll start by simply enumerating the RSS elements using <code>for</code> loop and printing the results and then we'll refactor the code to use <em>tuples</em> and <em>sequence expressions</em> to turn it into processing code that generates a sequence of feed items. Finally we'll also demonstrate how to use some of the functions from the previous part such as <code>List.filter</code> in practice.</p>

  quite a long time now as Microsoft Research project, but is now becoming a real Microsoft product.
  Interestingly, F# is still available as a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=7bb32f32-9fac-4f34-ad56-b0bda130cf00" type="external">plugin for Visual Studio 2008</a>, so if you want to try it
  you don't have to install the whole new beta of 2010.</p>

<p>There are already many resources for learning F# including my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-overview.aspx">functional programming overview</a>,
  which is a Manning Greenpaper for the book <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" type="external">Functional Programming for the Real World</a> that I'm writing with Jon Skeet
  and my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-i-introduction.aspx">four-part F# introduction</a>. There are also some useful links on the 
  official <a href="http://www.fsharp.net">F# web site</a> including some talk recordings. However, I haven't yet seen any good F# webcast focusing 
  mainly on showing F# source code, starting from simple functional concepts to the real-world features like asynchronous workflows and object-oriented 
  programming in F#, so I decided to create one.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-ii-break.aspx/">Imperative computation in F# (II.) - Writing break and continue</a></h1>
    
<p>As I already wrote in the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-i-return.aspx">first part of this series</a>,
  the F# language doesn't support some of the language constructs known from imperative
  languages such as C#. In particular, we cannot use imperative <code>return</code> statement
  that returns the result of a function from any place in the function code. In functional languages,
  every construct is an expression, so to get the overall result of the function, the 
  F# language evaluates the expression and the value of the expression is used as the result.
  In the previous article, we've seen that we can simulate this construct in the F# language
  using F# computation expressions and I showed how to implement computation named <code>imperative</code>
  that allows us to write for example the <code>exists</code> function for working with sequences
  like this:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
let exists f inp = imperative {
  for v in inp do 
    if f(v) then return true
  return false }
</pre>  
<p>In this article, we're going to look at two more imperative constructs and we're going
  to talk about <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>. We'll see that we can quite
  easily extend the computation builder from the previous article to allow writing code
  that is syntactically very close to what you would write in C#. As I already mentioned,
  there are of course some performance overheads when using computation expressions, but 
  I find it very interesting how nice imperative syntax we can get in functional F#:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
imperative { 
  for x in 1 .. 10 do 
    if (x % 3 = 0) then do! continue
    printfn "number = %d" x }
</pre>  
<p>The only difference between this code and the code we'd probably write if F# supported
  <code>continue</code> as a keyword is that we need to wrap the code inside the <code>imperative</code>
  computation and that we need to add the <code>do!</code> primitive before the <code>continue</code>
  value. Now that we've seen an example of using the <code>continue</code> value inside
  the imperative computations, let's look how we can extend the computation builder from
  the previous article to add this feature...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-i-return.aspx/">Imperative computation in F# (I.) - Returning results from a function</a></h1>
    
<p>One of the limitations of F# is that it doesn't very well support some of the 
  advanced imperative language constructs such as <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>
  or imperative style of returning value from a function, meaning that you can't write
  something like <code>return false</code> in the middle of the function. This has 
  good reasons. F# doesn't in principle have the notion of <em>currently executing statement</em>
  and instead treat every code you write as an expression. Clearly, when there is no 
  <em>current statement</em>, we cannot jump to other statements. If you're looking
  for more information about these basic principles, you can take a look at my book 
  <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external">Real World Functional 
  Programming</a>, which covers this distinction in details in chapter 2, but we'll look 
  at a brief example that will clarify this idea shortly.</p>

<p>Often, there is really no need to use <code>break</code> or other imperative constructs
  in F#, because you can write the same thing more elegantly using one of the provided higher
  order function such as <code>Seq.exists</code> or <code>Seq.tryfind</code>. However,
  there are still some cases where the imperative programming style makes it easier 
  to express our original intention. Also, implementing your own higher order
  functions (akin to <code>Seq.exists</code>) would sometimes be much easier if we
  could just use imperative return.</p>  
<p>So, what can be done about this?</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-2nd-review.aspx/">Real World Functional Programming: Second review finished!</a></h1>
    
<p>I've been working on the <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external">Real World Functional Programming in .NET</a>
  book for quite some time now. In fact, I had the first discussions with Michael Stephens 
  from Manning in March last year and I started thinking about the book at that time, so it 
  has been occupying my mind for almost a year now! Until recently, I was feeling that
  we're not getting much closer to the end of this project, because writing a book is just 
  <em>a lot</em> of work. However, I think I can finally see that we're getting closer to
  actually finishing the book. At Manning, we've recently finished the second review, which means
  that I've just got another set of very useful comments - a big thanks to all the reviewers! 
  I'm also getting close to finishing the first draft of the whole manuscript (depending on the
  reviews, the content may still change a bit, but I expect to write at most one new chapter
  from now). Hopefully, the drafts will soon make it to the MEAP release of the book.</p>

<p>As you can see, there has been quite a bit of silence on this blog for a while. 
  There are two reasons for that - the first is that I'm still working on the book 
  <a type="external" href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real World Functional
  Programming</a>, so all my writing activities are fully dedicated to the book. The second
  reason is that I'm having a great time doing an internship in the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/ppt">Programming Principles and Tools</a> group
  at Microsoft Research in Cambridge with the F# team and namely the F# language 
  designer <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" type="external">Don Syme</a>.

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-overview.aspx/">Functional Programming in .NET using C# and F# (Manning Greenpaper)</a></h1>
    
<p>
  Functional programming languages have been around for a while and were always astonishing for their 
  ability to express the ideas in a succinct, declarative way allowing the developer to focus on the 
  essence of problem rather than on technical details of the solution. Recently, functional paradigm is 
  gaining new prominence as an efficient way to handle development of multi-processor, parallel and 
  asynchronous applications.</p>

<p>
  Functional ideas are arising in C# as well as in other main-stream languages and functional languages 
  are becoming an alternative for real-world projects.  Also, Microsoft recently introduced a new 
  language called F#, which has a strong background in traditional functional languages, but as a .NET 
  language also benefits from the rich .NET and Visual Studio ecosystem.</p>

<p>
  This article is partially an excerpt from my book <strong><a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a></strong> [<a href="#fpgpref">1</a>]. 
  Thanks to my editors at <a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external">Manning</a> I have the permission
  to publish it on my blog. We’ll look at several aspects of functional programming and how the same 
  concepts, which are essential for the functional paradigm, look in the F# and in C# 3.0 with LINQ. We 
  will shortly look at the basic programming language features like lambda functions and type inference 
  that are now available in both F# and C#. Functional programming isn’t only about language features, 
  but also about using different programming style, so we’ll look at some high level concepts as well. 
  These include using immutable data structures for developing code that can be executed in parallel 
  and writing code in a more declarative style.</p>

<p>
  Thanks to the combination of C# 3.0 and F#, this article shows the ideas in a way that should be 
  familiar to you in C#, but also shows a further step that you can take with a primarilly functional
  language F#. If you're a .NET developer and you want to understand what functional programming is
  and how it can help you to become better and more productive then continue reading. If you'll find 
  this article interesting, then don't forget to check out the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">book</a>,
  which explains everything in larger detail and discusses many other interesting ideas.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-iv-reactivegame.aspx/">Reactive Programming (IV.) - Developing a game in Reactive LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>In this part of the article series about <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>we're going to 
  implement a slightly more complicated application using the library that I introduced
  in the previous three articles. We're going to use basic event stream queries from the <a href="reactive-ii-csevents.aspx">second article</a> 
  as well as advanced operators introduced in the <a href="reactive-iii-linqoperators.aspx">third part</a>.
  This time, I'll also show the F# version of all the examples, so we're going to build on the ideas from
  the <a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">first part</a>.</p>

<p>I originally wanted to write the demo only in Visual Basic, because I think that
  it is really amazig to show an idea that came from functional programming in a language
  that no one (maybe until recently) connects with functional programming. Then I realized that
  I really want to show the F# version too, because F# was an inspiration for the whole
  <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> idea and it is interesting alone as well. But finally,
  I thought that don't showing the C# version may look offensive to many readers (especially 
  since I'm still C# MVP...). So, I ended up writing the game in all three languages, but 
  the code is surprisingly similar in all of them!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-iii-linqoperators.aspx/">Reactive Programming (III.) - Useful Reactive LINQ Operators</a></h1>
    
<p>In the <a href="reactive-ii-csevents.aspx">previous article</a>, I introduced <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>.
  I explained the different point of view that we can use when working with .NET events. The idea is that
  .NET events can be viewed as streams of values. The value is information about the event (such as position
  of a mouse click or a mouse movement). These streams can be processed using LINQ queries - we can for example
  filter all values that are not interesting for us using <code>where</code> LINQ clause. For example if we want to handle
  clicks only in some specified area.</p>
<p>In the previous article, I talked about basic LINQ query operators such as <code>select</code> and <code>where</code>
  and some useful methods that <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> provides (for example for merging event streams).
  Today, we'll take a look at two more advanced kinds of operations that we can use for working with event streams. 
  In particular, we'll talk about aggregation operators (that you certainly know from LINQ) and about switching. 
  Switching is a concept from functional reactive programming and it allows us to change dynamically how the 
  application behaves. However, I'll explain this in a more detail soon.</p>
<p>In this article, I'm going to use mostly C# (and some Visual Basic). The functionality that I'm describing
  in this part isn't part of the standard F# <code>Event</code> module that I discussed in 
  <a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">the first part</a>. I implemented most of them in F# too, but I'm not going
  to write the samples in both of the versions in this part. If you've seen the first two articles, you'll be 
  definitely able to use the F# versions as well, because they follow exactly the same ideas as the C#/LINQ versions.
  I'm going to talk about a larger demo application in the last section and I'll show an F# version as well,
  so you'll see some F# examples in the next part. This part serves more as a reference of the available
  operators, so you may read only some parts of it, then jump to the last one (to see an exciting example!) 
  and then come back here.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-ii-csevents.aspx/">Reactive programming (II.) - Introducing Reactive LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article I'm going to introduce my project <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>. This is largely inspired
  by the ideas that come from functional reactive programming in the Haskell language and from 
  functionality that's available for working in events in F#. I introduced these ideas in my previous article
  in this mini-series, so if you're interested in learning more about these interesting technologies, you 
  should definitely read the previous article about <a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">First class events in F#</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we're going to look how to apply the same ideas to the C# language and how 
  to use LINQ queries for processing events. This article is <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx">just</a>&#160;<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx">another</a> my article that shows how to implement some 
  idea from functional programmin in C#. I believe this will once again show that the new features
  in the C# 3.0 aren't just about querying databases, but are more widely useful even in situations 
  that are not directly related to data-processing. </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-i-fsevents.aspx/">Reactive programming (I.) - First class events in F#</a></h1>
    
<p>I believe that the LINQ project and changes in C# 3.0 and VB 9 are interesting because they 
  allow rewriting of many ideas from functional programming. An ability to express queries easily
  is one of these ideas, but it is definitely not the only one. There are many other interesting ideas.
  The C# 3.0 language isn't primary a functional language, so it isn't easy to discover the idea
  if you use only C#, but it is possible to implement it if you know the idea already.</p>
<p>I already wrote a few interesting C# examples that were inspired by some functional idea.
  I'm a big fan of the F# language, so it is not a surprise that I started with an F# version
  of the problem and then looked at the way to do the same thing in C#. In particular, this is 
  how my article about building dynamic queries in C# came to the existence - the F# version used
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-flinq.aspx">FLINQ and Quotations</a> and then I demonstrated how to do the same in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx">C# 
  using expression trees</a>. Another example is my article about asynchronous 
  programming in C# <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx">using iterators</a>, which shows how to implement something 
  like F# <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/11/introducing-f-asynchronous-workflows.aspx">asynchronous workflows using iterators</a> in C# 2.0.</p>

<h3>Functional Reactive Programming</h3>  
<p>Today, I'm going to look at another very interesting idea from functional programming. It is 
  called <em>Functional Reactive Programming</em> and it comes from the Haskell community. You can find 
  a list of related <a href="http://www.haskell.org/frp/" type="external">Haskell projects here</a>.
  However, similar things (though they are not purely functional and simplified) are available 
  in the F# language as well. Don Syme introduced them in his blog post called 
  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2006/03/24/559582.aspx">F# First Class Events: Simplicity and Compositionality in Imperative Reactive Programming</a>. In this article, I'm going to briefly introduce the implementation
  available in F# and I'll extend it a little bit to allow some more interesting things. In the 
  second article from this series, I'll show how to implement the same thing in C# 3.0 (and in VB 9 too!)</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/sequences-on-msdn.aspx/">Calculating with infinite sequences on MSDN</a></h1>
    
<p>About a year ago, I wrote <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/lazy-computation-on-msdn.aspx">an article</a> about using lazy computations in C# 3.0. It was published by the C# Community PM <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/" type="external">Charlie Calvert</a> at the C# Developer Center. The article was a first of two articles where I wanted to demonstrate that C# 3.0 can be used for implementing useful constructs known from functional languages. I realized that I never posted the link to the second article to my blog, so you can find the annotation and link below.</p>

<p>However, I remembered about these two articles because I was just working on chapters 11 and 12 of the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-net-update.aspx">Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a> book that I’m writing. Lazy values, which were the topic of my first article, are discussed in the second part of chapter 11 and IEnumerable and F# sequences are the topic for the first part of chapter 12. Because I already wrote two articles on this topic, I had to think really hard to find better (and still simple enough) examples where these concepts are useful in practice. I also finally have enough space to show how these two concepts relate and talk about some interesting background – for example in Haskell, lazy sequences are in fact just ordinary lists that are lazy thanks to the Haskell nature. </p>
<p>A year ago, I definitely wouldn’t believe that today, I’ll be writing about the same topics, but this time as part of a book that has partly the same goal as these two articles – to show that functional programming ideas are really useful in the real-world and can enrich your programming toolbox (no matter whether you’re using C# or F# language). Anyway, here is the link to the second article – as usual when I look at something that I worked on a long time ago, I think I should rewrite it to make it better :-), but it still gives you an idea what is the book that I’m working on about...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-net-update.aspx/">Functional Programming in .NET book - An update</a></h1>
    
<p>Recently, I announced on my blog that I’m working on a book for <a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external">Manning</a> 
  called <em>Real world Functional Programming in .NET</em>. The goal of the book is to explain the most interesting and
  useful ideas of functional programming to a real world C# developer. I'm writing this book, because I believe that functional programming is becoming
  increasingly important. Here is a couple of reasons why you should have this book on your bookshelf:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ideas behind C# 3.0 and LINQ</strong> - these main-stream technologies are inspired by functional programming and the new 
    C# 3.0 features give us definitely much more than just a new way to query databases. The book explains
    the ideas behind these features and shows how to use them more efficiently.</li>
    
  <li><strong>Learning the F# language</strong> - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx" type="external">F# is becoming a first-class citizen</a>
    in the Visual Studio family of languages, which alone would be a good reason for learning it! Even if you're not going
    to use it for your next large .NET project, you'll find it useful for quick prototyping of ideas and testing how .NET libraries
    work thanks to the great interactive tools.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Real world examples</strong> - the book includes a large set of real-world examples that show how to develop 
    real applications in a functional way - both in F# and C#. Among other things, the examples show how to utilize multi-core 
    CPUs, how to better obtain and process data and how to implement animations and GUI applications in a functional way.</li>
</ul>  

<p>The book is available via the MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) and if you want to get a better idea what is the book about, 
  you can read the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/" type="external">first chapter for free</a>. Anyway, it is more than a month since I  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-programming-book.aspx">posted the announcement</a>, so I decided to write a brief update....</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-programming-book.aspx/">Announcing: Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a></h1>
    
<p>If you’ve been reading my blog or seen some my articles, you know that I’m a big fan of the F# language and functional programming style. I’m also often trying to present a bit different view of C# and LINQ – for me it is interesting mainly because it brings many functional features to a main-stream language and allows using of many of the functional patterns in a real-world. Elegant way for working with data, which is the most commonly used feature of C# 3.0, is just one example of this functional approach. Talking about real-world applications of functional programming, there is also fantastic news about F#. It was announced last year that F# will become fully supported Visual Studio language and the first CTP version of F# was released this week!</p>

<p>I always thought that the topics mentioned in the previous paragraph are really interesting and that functional programming will continue to become more and more important. That’s why I’m really excited by the news that I’d like to announce today – I’m writing a book about functional programming in F# and C#....</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-iv-lang.aspx/">F# Overview (IV.) - Language Oriented Programming</a></h1>
    
<p>In the fourth article of the F# overview series, I will shortly describe how I understad the language oriented paradigm and how the F# language can be used for developing libraries using this paradigm. We will look how discriminated unions relate to this paradigm and at three specific features that support this paradigm, namely <em>active patterns</em>, <em>computation expressions</em> and <em>quotations</em>.</p>

<p>Defining precisely what the term <em>language oriented programming</em> means in context of the F# language would be difficult,
  so I will instead explain a few examples that will demonstrate how I understand it. In general, the goal of language oriented
  programming is to develop a <em>language</em> that would be suitable for some (more specific) class of tasks and use this language 
  for solving these tasks. Of course, developing a real programming language is extremely complex problem, so there are several ways
  for making it easier. As the most elementary example, you can look at XML files (with certain schema) as language that 
  are processed by your program and solve some specific problem (for example configuring the application). As a side note,
  I should mention that I'm not particularly happy with the term ‘language’ in this context, because the term can be used
  for describing a wide range of techniques from very trivial constructs to a complex object-oriented class libraries, 
  but I have not seen any better term for the class of techniques that I’m going to talk about.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-iii-oop.aspx/">F# Overview (III.) - Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming</a></h1>
    
<p>In the third part of the F# Overview article series, we will look at language features that are mostly well known, because they are present in most of the currently used programming languages. Indeed, I'm talking about imperative programming, which is a common way for storing and manipulating application data and about object oriented programming which is used for structuring complex programs.</p>
<p>In general, F# tries to make using them together with the functional constructs described in the <a href="fsharp-ii-functional.aspx">previous part</a> [<a href="fsharp-ii-functional.aspx" target="_blank">^</a>] as natural as possible, which yields several very powerful language constructs.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-ii-functional.aspx/">F# Overview (II.) - Functional Programming</a></h1>
    
<p>In the second part of the F# overview we will look at functional programming, which is probably the most important paradigm used with the F# language, because F# is built on the same grounds as many functional languages. We will first examine the standard F# data types, which are useful to allow the functional programming style and we will also look at a few functional tricks.</p> 

<p>As already mentioned in the <a href="fsharp-i-introduction.aspx">Introduction</a> for this article series,
  F# is a typed functional language, by which I mean that types of all values are determined during the compile-time. 
  However, thanks to the use of a type inference, the types are explicitly specified in the code very rarely as we will see in the 
  following examples. Basic data types (aside from a standard set of primitive numeric and textual types that are present in any 
  .NET language) available in F# are tuple, discriminated union, record, array, list, function and object. In the following 
  quick overview, we will use the F# interactive, which is a tool that compiles and executes the entered text on the fly.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-i-introduction.aspx/">F# Overview (I.) - Introduction</a></h1>
    
<p>In my bachelor thesis I included a short introduction that covered all of the important aspects
  of the F# programming language and I thought that it may be useful to extend it a little bit to cover
  also a topics that were not important for my thesis and post it as an article, so there is one and 
  relatively short article that introduces all the interesting F# features. The article got however a
  bit longer than I expected, so I decided to split it into a three parts that would introduce three
  different <em>paradigms</em> that are supported by F#. Of course, this series won't teach you
  everything about F#, but it tries to cover the main F# design goals and (hopefully) presents
  all the features that make F# interesting and worth learning. In this first part I will shortly introduce 
  F# and the supported paradigms that will be discussed in the upcoming articles.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/lazy-computation-on-msdn.aspx/">Lazy Computation in C# on MSDN</a></h1>
    
<p>I think that one of the interesting things about C# 3.0 is that it gives you the ability to use many techniques known from functional languages (like Haskell or F#). Most of the articles about C# 3.0 and LINQ focus on the queries and LINQ to SQL, but I believe that using these functional techniques deserve some attention as well. This is why I'm very happy that my article about one of these techniques - representing lazy computations - is now available at the C# Developer Center. I would like to thank to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/default.aspx">Charlie Calvert</a> [<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/default.aspx" target="_blank">^</a>], who is the Community Program Manager for C# and who edited and published my article there. Here is the annotation:</p>

<p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">Most of the programming languages used in practice (including for example C#, VB.NET, C++, Python or Java) employ so called eager evaluation, which means that the program evaluates all expression and statements in the order in which they are written, so all the preceding statements and expressions are evaluated before executing the next piece of code. This, for example, means that all arguments to a method call are evaluated before calling the method. Sometimes it may be useful to delay an execution of some code until the result is actually needed, either because the result may not be needed at all (but we can’t tell that before executing some computation) or because we don’t want to block the program for a long time by executing all computations in advance and instead we want to execute the computations later, when we will actually need the result. </p>

<p style="padding-left:40px;margin-bottom:20px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">In this article we will look how these lazy computations can be written in C# (using some of the new language features from version 3.0). We will first implement a Lazy class to represent this kind of computation, then look at a few simple examples to demonstrate how the class can be used, and finally we will examine one slightly more complicated, but practically useful application.

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsparallelops.aspx/">Keep your multi-core CPU busy with F#</a></h1>
    
<p>The growth of computer CPU speed is slowly being replaced by the growth of number of CPUs 
  (or cores) in the computer at least for the close future. This causes a revolution in the way software is 
  written, because traditional and most widely used way of writing concurrent applications using
  threads is difficult and brings several serious issues. Some predictions say that within a few
  years, almost every computer will have about 16 cores, so there is a huge need for programming
  paradigms or idioms that help developers write concurrent software easily (see also <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">The Free Lunch Is Over</a> 
  [<a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm" target="_blank">^</a>] written by Herb Sutter).</p>

<p>Functional programming languages (especially pure functional languages) are interesting from 
  this point of view, because the program doesn't have side-effects which makes it very easy to 
  parallelize it (programs in pure functional languages can't have any side-effects by design, in other functional
  languages like F# the side-effects can be eliminated by following functional programming style). </p>

<p>This article describes the code that makes it possible to parallelize some common F# constructs like the <code>List.map</code> and <code>List.filter</code>...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp3-concepts.aspx/">Concepts behind the C# 3.0 language</a></h1>
    
<p>One of the lectures that I attended last year was <a href="http://www.mff.cuni.cz/toISO-8859-2.en/vnitro/is/sis/predmety/kod.php?kod=PRG003">Programming Methodology and Philosophy of Programming Languages</a>. The lecture was mostly about history of programming languages and how several features evolved, disappeared and than after many years appeared again in another programming language.</p>

<p>As I final work I decided to write an article that describes ideas that influenced the design of the C# 3.0 language. Some of these features are known from functional languages (for example from LISP or Haskell), some other were developed at Microsoft Research and appeared in the F# language or Cω. I also wanted to show in what ways are these features limited in the C# 3.0. I think that thanks to these limitation, the C# 3.0 is still a simple (or at least not difficult) to understand which is very important for mainstream language, but I find it interesting to know what is possible in other (less limited) languages.</p>
