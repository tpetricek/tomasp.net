    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2023/pompidou/">What can routers at Centre Pompidou teach us about software evolution?</a></h1>
    <p>Back in June, I was in Paris for the <a href="https://ncrafts.io/">NewCrafts conference</a> to talk about
<a href="https://vimeopro.com/newcrafts/newcrafts/video/842234359">the growing opacity of software systems</a>.
This was fun, partly because NewCrafts is a fantastic conference (you can already <a href="https://ncrafts.io/">get your
tickets</a> for 2024!) and also partly because my talk (arguing against many
established "good engineering" practices) was in many ways arguing for the exact opposite than
one of the keynotes, leading to many interesting conversations.</p>
<p>While in Paris, I also visited the <a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/">famous Centre Pompidou</a>.
Perhaps to the dismay of many modern art lovers, I spent a lot of time staring at the ceiling
looking for routers.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2023/vague-spaces/">Where programs live? Vague spaces and software systems</a></h1>
    <p>Architecture and urban planning have been a useful source of ideas for thinking about programming.
I have written <a href="https://tomasp.net/blog/tag/design/">various blog posts</a> and a paper
<a href="https://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/">Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning</a>
that argue why and explore some of those ideas. Like urban planning and architecture, the design of
any interesting software system deals with complex problems that can rarely be analysed in full and
with structures that will continue to evolve in unexpected ways after they are created.</p>
<p>My most recent reading on cities was a book <a href="https://www.academia.cz/mesto-naruby-2-dotisk--haluzik-radan--academia--2021">The City Inside Out</a>
(Czech only, unfortunately) that explore places referred to as <a href="https://www.atributosurbanos.es/en/terms/terrain-vague/">terrain vague</a>.
This term refers to unused and abandoned spaces that have lost their purpose or
do not have a clear use, but are used in various ways nevertheless. For various historical
reasons, there seem to be quite a few of such places in Prague (Figure 1) and, more generally,
Central European cities, which is the focus of the book.</p>
<p>The book is an interesting inspiration for thinking about programming in many ways.
It uses an inter-disciplinary approach ranging from history and philosophy to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoethnobotany">archaeobotany</a>, which is much needed for thinking
about programming too. (Not archeobotany, but inter-disciplinary thinking certainly!)
More specifically, it makes you think about the concept of a <em>space</em> in
which cities and programs exist, how the spaces inhabited by the two differ, what would it look
like if they were different and what structures get created in those spaces as a result of
social and technical forces.</p>

<p style="max-width:260px"><b>Figure 1.</b> The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander</p>
</div>
<p>Many programmers know the name of the architect Christopher Alexander for his work on
<em>design patterns</em> that has been adapted into the world of programming. A lot of people
know of the, sometimes ridiculed, patterns like strategy (functions!) or visitor (pattern
matching!) and some have read the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Cd7sBv" title="Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software - Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides">Gang of Four design patterns book</a> that introduced them.
A few people know of the <a href="https://dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf" title="Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community - Richard P. Gabriel">Patterns of Software</a> book by Richard P. Gabriel, which is a much more
profound reflection on software inspired by the work of Christopher Alexander. And almost
nobody has actually read Christopher Alexander's books. (Thanks in advance for reminding me
on <a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">Twitter</a> that I am mistaken...)</p>
<p>I read Alexander's <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2" title="Notes on the Synthesis of Form - Christopher Alexander">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a> a couple of years ago, and used
it as one of the sources for ideas in my recent Onward! essay on <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/" title="Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning - Tomas Petricek">architecture, design and urban
planning</a>, but I did not know his other work. Only recently, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/29/christopher-alexander-obituary">Christopher Alexander
died</a>,
I finally ordered two books that are most directly about design patterns,
<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">The Timeless Way of Building</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3wecpGG" title="A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction - Christopher Alexander">A Pattern Language</a>.</p>
<p>This post is a somewhat unorganized collection of thoughts triggered by reading of The Timeless
Way of Building, including my understanding of Alexander's work, some critical thoughts
and on the applications of his ideas to software.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2022/no-code-substrates/">No-code, no thought? Substrates for simple programming for all</a></h1>
    <div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2022/no-code-substrates/flow-matic.png" style="max-width:350px" />
<p style="max-width:350px"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Virtually eliminates your coding load. FLOW-MATIC promotional
brochure (1957)</p>
</div>
<p>No-code is a hot new topic for programming startups. The idea is to develop a system
that allows end-users to do the programming they need without the difficult task of writing
code. There are no-code systems for building mobile apps, analysing data and many more.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not a surprise that "eliminating programming load" is not as new idea as some
people may think and there is an excellent blog series on <a href="https://instadeq.com/blog/categories/history/" title="No-code history - Instadeq Blog - No-code Data Analysis &amp; Interactive Visualizations">no-code history by Instadeq</a>,
going back to 1959.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the 1957 <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102646140" title="Introducing a New Language for Automatic Programming Univac Flow-Matic">promotional brochure about FLOW-MATIC</a>,
a predecessor to COBOL created by Grace Hopper, uses almost the same language that you will
find in startup pitch decks today (Figure 1). Of course, in 1957, coding referred to the
tedious process of transcribing the desired program to low-level assembler or (more often)
directly to machine code and "virtually eliminating your coding load" meant having a symbolic
high-level programming language so easy that a reasonably skilled mathematician would be able
to use it.</p>
<p>So, is there really anything new about no-code systems? Is it really possible to "eliminate
your programming load"? And what would it really take to make some real progress in that direction?</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/learning-and-programming/">Is deep learning a new kind of programming? Operationalistic look at programming</a></h1>
    <p>In most discussions about how to make programming better, someone eventually says
something along the lines of <em>"we'll just have to wait until deep learning solves
the problem!"</em> I think this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">naively optimistic idea</a>,
but it raises one interesting question: In what sense are programs created using deep
learning a <em>different kind</em> of programs than those written by hand?</p>
<div class="rdecor">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/learning-and-programming/bridgman.jpg" style="max-width:350px"/>
</div>
<p>This question recently arose in discussions that we have been having as part of the
<a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/">PROGRAMme project</a>, which explores historical and
philosophical perspectives on the question "What is a (computer) program?" and so this
article owes much debt to <a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/members">others involved in the project</a>,
especially Maël Pégny, Liesbeth De Mol and Nick Wiggershaus.</p>
<p>Many people will intuitively think that, if you train a deep neural network to solve some
a problem, you get a different kind of program than if you manually write some logic to solve
the problem. But what exactly is the difference? In both cases, the program is a sequence of
instructions that are deterministically executed by a machine, one after another, to produce
the result.</p>
<p>When reading the excellent book <a href="https://amzn.to/2SvTwKT" title="Hasok Chang (2004). Inventing Temperature: Measurement and Scientific Progress">Inventing Temperature</a> by Hasok
Chang recently, I came across the idea of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/operationalism/" title="Hasok Chang (2019). Operationalism, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy">operationalism</a>,
which I believe provides a useful perspective for thinking about the issue of deep learning and
programming. The operationalist point of view was introduced by a physicist Percy Williams Bridgman. To
quote: <em>we mean by any concept nothing more than a set of operations; the concept is synonymous
with the corresponding set of operations</em>. What does this tell us about deep learning and programming?</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/data-exploration-calculus/">Data exploration calculus: Capturing the essence of exploratory data scripting</a></h1>
    <p>Most real-world programming languages are too complex to be studied using formal methods.
For this reason, academics often work with simple theoretical languages instead. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">λ-calculus</a>
is a simple formal language that is often used for talking about functional languages, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">π-calculus</a>
is a model of concurrent programming and there is an entire book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8598-9">A Theory of Objects</a>
modelling various object-oriented systems.</p>
<div class="rdecor"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/data-exploration-calculus/ft.gif" style="width:360px"/><br/><p style="width:360px;line-height:20px;margin-top:10px;text-align:center;"><small>Animation from Financial Times article "Why the world's recycling system stopped working".</small></p></div>
<p>Those calculi try to capture the most interesting aspect of the programming language. This is
function application in functional programming, sending of messages in concurrent programming
and object construction with inheritance in object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been working on programming tools for data exploration.
In particular, I'm interested in the kind of programming that journalists need to do when
they work with data. A good example is the coding done for the
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8">Why the world's recycling system stopped working</a>
article by Financial Times, which is <a href="https://github.com/ft-interactive/recycling-is-broken-notebooks">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Although data journalists and other data scientists use regular programming languages like
Python, the kind of code they write is very different from the kind of code you need to write
when building a library or a web application in Python.</p>
<p>In a paper <a href="https://programming-journal.org/2020/4/8/">Foundations of a live data exploration environment</a>
that was published in February 2020 in the open access <a href="https://programming-journal.org/">Programming Journal</a>,
I wanted to talk about some interesting work that I've been doing on live previews in
<a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma</a>. For this, I needed a small model of my programming language.</p>
<p>In the end the most interesting aspect of the paper is the definition of the
<em>data exploration calculus</em>, a small programming language that captures the kind of code
that data scientists write to explore data. This looks quite different from,
say, a λ-calculus and π-calculus. It should be interesting not only if you're planning to do
theoretical programming language research about data scripting, but also because
it captures some of the atypical properties of the programs that data scientists write...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/">On architecture, urban planning and software construction</a></h1>
    <p>Despite having the term <em>science</em> in its name, it is not always clear what kind of
discipline <em>computer science</em> actually is. Research on programming is sometimes like
science, sometimes like mathematics, sometimes like engineering, sometimes like design
and sometimes like art. It also has a long tradition of importing ideas from a wide range
of other disciplines.</p>
<p>In this article, I will look at ideas from architecture and urban planning. Architecture
has already been an inspiration for <em>design patterns</em>, although some would say that we did
quite poor job and imported a trivialized (and not very useful) version of the idea. However,
there are many other interesting ideas in architecture and urban planning worth exploring.</p>
<div class="rdecor-sm"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/patterns.jpg" /></div>
<p>To explain why learning from architecture and urban planning is a good idea, I will first
discuss similarities between problems solved by architects or urban planners and programmers.
I will then look at a number of concrete ideas that we can learn, mostly taking inspiration
from four books that I've read recently. There are two general areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, writing about architecture and urban planning often uses interesting methodologies
that research on programming could adopt to gain new insights into systems, programming
and its problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, there are a number of more concrete ideas in architecture and urban planning that
might directly apply to software. For example, can programmers learn how to deal with complexity
of software by looking at how urban planners deal with the complexity of cities? Or, can we learn
about software maintenance by looking at how buildings evolve in time?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The nature of problems that programmers face are often more similar to the problems that
architects and urban planners have to deal with than, say, the problems that scientists, engineers
or mathematicians need to solve. We might not want to go all the way and completely rebuild
how we do programming to mirror architecture and urban planning, but treating the ideas from those
disciplines as equal to those from science or engineering will make programming richer and more
productive discipline.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2019/first-language/">What to teach as the first programming language and why</a></h1>
    <p>The number of Google search results for the phrase
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=" title="choosing+the+first+programming+language">"choosing the first programming language"</a>
at the time of writing is 15,800. This illustrates just how debated the issue of choosing the first
programming language is. In this blog post, I will not actually try to answer the question posed
in the title of the post. I will not discuss what language we should teach as the first one.
Instead, I will look at a more interesting question.</p>
<p>I will investigate the arguments that are used in favour of or against particular programming
languages in computer science curriculum. I am more interested in the kind of argumentation that
is employed to support a particular choice than in the specific languages involved. This approach is
valuable for two reasons. First, by looking at the argumentation used, we can learn what educators
consider important about computer science. Second, understanding the motivations behind different
arguments allows us to make our own debates about the choice of a programming language more informed.</p>
<p>The scope of this blog post is limited to the choice of the first programming language taught in an
undergraduate computer science programmes at universities. This means that I will not discuss other
important contexts such as choices at a primary or a secondary education level, choices for
independent learners and choices in other university degrees that might involve programming.</p>
<p>Note that this blog post is adapted from an essay that I wrote as part of a
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/teaching/qualifications/pgche/">Postgrduate Certificate for Higher Education programme</a>
at University of Kent, so it assumes less knowledge about programming than a typical reader of
my blog has. This makes it accessible to a broader audience thinking about education
though!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/programming-interaction/">Programming as interaction: A new perspective for programming language research</a></h1>
    <p>In May, I joined the <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/">School of Computing</a> at the <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of
Kent</a> as a Lecturer (equivalent of Assistant Professor in some other countries).
When applying for the job, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to best explain the kind of
research that I would like to do. This blog post is a brief summary of my ideas. I'm interested
in way too many things, including <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/philosophy/">philosophy and design</a> and
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/data-journalism/">data journalism</a>, but this post will be mainly about
programming language research. After all, I'm a member of the <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/research/groups/plas/">Programming Languages
and Systems group</a>!</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/programming-interaction/kent.png" class="rdecor-sm" style="max-width:250px"/>
<p>Unlike some of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thinking-unthinkable/">other posts about programming languages</a>,
I won't try to convince you that we should be studying programming languages completely differently this
time. Instead, I want to describe <em>one simple trick that will make current programming language
research much more interesting</em>!</p>
<p>A lot of programming language papers today talk about programs and program properties. In
statically typed programming languages, we can check that a program <span class="math">\(e\)</span> has certain type <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>,
which means that, when the program is run, it will only produce values of the type.
This is very nice, but it misses a fundamental thing about programming. How was this program
<span class="math">\(e\)</span> actually constructed?</p>
<p>When programming, you spend most of your time working with programs that are <em>unfinished</em>. This
means that they do not do what they are supposed to be (eventually) doing and, very often, they
are not well-typed or even syntactically invalid. However, that does not mean that we can afford
to ignore them. In many cases, programmers can even run those programs (using REPL or using a
notebook environment). In other words, programming language research should not study <em>programs</em>,
but should instead study <em>programming</em>!</p>

I'm also writing this because I'll soon be looking for collaborators and PhD students,
so if the ideas in this blog post sound interesting to you or if you've been working on
something related, please let me know! You can get in touch at <a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">@tomaspetricek</a>
or email <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have funding for PhD students from September 2019 and I'm also working on getting money
for a post-doc position. All of these are open ended, so if the blog post made you curious
(and you wouldn't mind living in Canterbury or London), definitely reach out!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/alien-lambda-calculus/">Would aliens understand lambda calculus?</a></h1>
    <p>Unless you are a sci-fi author or some secret government agency, the question whether aliens
would understand lambda calculus is probably not your main practical concern. However, the question
is intriguing because it nicely vividly formulates a fundamental question about our formal mathematical
knowledge. Are mathematical theories and results about them <em>invented</em>, i.e. constructed by
humans, or <em>discovered</em>, i.e. are they eternal truths that exist regardless of whether there are
humans to know them?</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/alien-lambda-calculus/human.jpg" class="rdecor"
    style="width:40%;max-width:400px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" />
<p>The question makes for a fantastic late night pub debate, but how can we go about answering it using
a more serious methodology? Is there a paper one can read to better understand the problem?
Occasionally, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R&amp;v=IOiZatlZtGU">talk</a>
or an <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-aliens-have-LISP-or-Scheme">online comment</a>
by a computer scientist comments on this question, but way too often, people miss the fact that
the nature of mathematical entities is one of the fundamental questions of <em>philosophy of
mathematics</em>. Alas, all those discussions are carefully hidden in the humanities department!</p>
<p>I believe that knowing a bit about philosophy of mathematics is important if we want to have a
meaningful debate about philosophical questions of mathematics (sic!) and so I did a talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoWH2jNlvQQ">on this very subject at CodeMesh 2017</a>.
This article is slightly refined and hopefully
more polished version of the talk for those who, like me, prefer reading over watching.
Keep in mind that the question about the nature of mathematical entities is one of the fundamental
questions of an <em>entire academic discipline</em>. As such, this article cannot possibly cover all the
relevant discussions. Compared to some other writings in this space, this article is, at least,
based on a couple of philosophical books that, I believe, have useful things to say on the subject!</p>

    <div style="text-align:center">

<p>The word "design" is often used when talking about programming languages. In fact, it even made
it into the name of one of the most prestigious academic programming conferences, <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/PLDI/">Programming
Language Design and Implementation (PLDI)</a>. Yet, it is
almost impossible to come across a paper about programming languages that uses design methods to
study its subject. We intuitively feel that "design" is an important aspect of programming
languages, but we never found a way to talk about it and instead treat programming languages as
mathematical puzzles or as engineering problems.</p>
<p>This is a shame. Applying design thinking, in the sense used in applied arts, can let us talk
about, explore and answer important questions about programming languages that are ignored when
we limit ourselves to mathematical or engineering methods. I think the programming language
community is, perhaps unconsciously, aware of this - one of the reviews of <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/fsharp-data/">my recent PLDI
paper</a> said <em>"this is a nice, novel design paper,
and the community often wants more design papers in our conferences"</em>. The problem is that we
we do not know how to write and evaluate work that follows design methodology.</p>
<p>To better understand how design works, I recently read <a href="http://amzn.to/2gVxn8W">The Philosophy of Design</a>
by Glenn Parsons. The book perhaps did not answer many of my questions about design, but it did give
me a number of ideas about what design is, what questions it can explore and how those could be
relevant for the study of programming languages...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/papers-we-scrutinize/">Papers we Scrutinize: How to critically read papers</a></h1>
    <p>As someone who enjoys being at the intersection of the academic world and the world of
industry, I'm very happy to see any attempts at bridging this harmful gap. For this reason,
it is great to see that <a href="http://michaelrbernste.in/2014/10/21/should-i-read-papers.html">more people are interested in reading academic
papers</a> and that initiatives
like <a href="http://paperswelove.org/">Papers We Love</a> are there to help.</p>
<a href="http://paperswelove.org/"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/papers-we-scrutinize/pwl.png" class="rdecor" style="width:300px;"/></a>
<p>There is one caveat with academic papers though. It is very easy to see academic papers
as containing eternal and unquestionable truths, rather than as something that the reader
should actively interact with. I <a href="https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek/status/814600193643577344">recently remarked</a>
about this saying that "reading papers" is too passive. I also mentioned one way of doing more
than just "reading", which is to write "critical reviews" – something that we recently tried
to do at the <a href="http://2017.programmingconference.org/track/refuses-2017">Salon des Refusés</a> workshop.
In this post, I would like to expand my remark.</p>
<p>First of all, it is very easy to miss the context in which papers are written. The life of an academic
paper is not complete after it is published. Instead, it continues living its own life – people refer to it
in various contexts, give different meanings to entities that appear in the paper and may "love"
different parts of the paper than the author. This also means that there are different ways of
reading papers. You can try to reconstruct the original historical context, read it according to
the current main-stream interpretation or see it as an inspiration for your own ideas.</p>
<p>I suspect that many people, both in academia and outside, read papers without worrying about
<em>how</em> they are reading them. You can certainly "do science" or "read papers" without reflecting
on the process. That said, I think the philosophical reflection is important if we do not want to
get stuck in local maxima.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/programming-mythology/">The mythology of programming language ideas</a></h1>
    <p>If you read a about the history of science, you will no doubt be astonished by some of the
amazing theories that people used to believe. I recently finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2mPjXtW">The Invention of Science
by David Wootton</a>, which documents many of them (and is well worth reading,
not just because of this!) For example, did you know that if you put garlic on a magnet, the magnet
will stop working? Fortunately, you can recover the magnet by smearing goats blood on it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_della_Porta">Giambattista
della Porta</a> tested this and concluded that it
was false, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ross_(writer)">Alexander Ross</a> argued that
our garlic is perhaps not so vigorous as those of ancient Greeks.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/programming-mythology/heliocentric.jpg">
  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/programming-mythology/heliocentric.jpg" class="rdecor"
    style="width:60%;max-width:400px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:20px" /></a></div>
<p>You can just laugh at these stories, but they can serve as interesting lessons for any scientist.
The lesson, however, is not the obvious one. Academics will <a href="http://danghica.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/what-else-are-we-getting-wrong.html">sometimes read those
stories</a> and use them
to argue against something they do not consider scientific - arguing that it is like believing
that garlic break magnets.</p>
<p>This is not how the analogy works. What is amazing about the old stories is that the conclusions
that now seem funny often had very solid reasoning behind them. If you believed in the basic
assumption of the time, then you could reach the same conclusions by following fairly sound
reasoning principles. In other words, the amazing theories were scientific and entirely reasonable.
The lesson is that what seems a completely reasonable idea now, may turn out to be wrong and quite
hilarious in retrospect.</p>
<p>In this article, I will look at a couple of amazing theories that people believed in the past
and I will explain why they were reasonable given the way of thinking of the time.
Along the way, I will explore some of the ways of thinking that we use today about
programming and computer science and why they might appear silly in the future.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/thegamma-talk/">Towards open and transparent data-driven storytelling: Notes from my Alan Turing Institute talk</a></h1>
    <p>As mentioned in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/">an earlier blog post</a>, I've been
spending some time at the <a href="http://turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> recently working on <a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma
project</a>. The goal is to make data visualizations on the web more transparent.
When you see a visualization online, you should be able to see where the data comes from, how it has been
transformed and check that it is not misleading, but you should also be able to modify it and
visualize other aspects of the data that interest you.</p>
<p>I gave a talk about my work as part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcr5vuAH5TPlYox-QLj4ySw/videos">talk series at The Alan Turing Institute</a>, which has
been recorded and is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjgpmzFjOA">now available on YouTube</a>. If you prefer to watch talks, this is a good
45 minute overview of what I've been working on with great video quality (the video switches from
camera view to screen capture for demos!)</p>

summary that highlights the most important ideas from the talk. You can also check out the

<p>Our thinking is shaped by basic assumptions that we rarely question. These assumptions exist at
different scales. Foucault's <em>episteme</em> describes basic assumptions of an epoch (such as Renaissance);
Kuhn's <em>research paradigms</em> determine how scientists of a given discipline approach problems and
Lakatos' <em>research programmes</em> provide undisputable assumptions followed by a group of scientists.</p>
<p>In this article, I try to discover some of the hidden assumptions in the area of programming
language research. What are assumptions that we never question and that determine how programming
languages are designed? And what might the world look like if we based our design method on
different basic principles?</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/no-functions/">Can programming be liberated from function abstraction?</a></h1>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/no-functions/lambda.png" style="width:180px" class="rdecor" />
<p>When you start working in the programming language theory business, you'll soon find out that
lambda abstraction and functions break many nice ideas or, at least, make your life very hard.
For example, type inference is easy if you only have <code>var x = ...</code>, but it gets hard once you
want to infer type of <code>x</code> in something like <code>fun x -&gt; ...</code> because we do not know what is
assigned to <code>x</code>. Distributed programming is another example - sending around data is easy, but
once you start sending around function values, things become hard.</p>
<p>Every programming language researcher soon learns this trick. When someone tells you about a nice
idea, you reply <em>"Interesting... but how does this interact with lambda abstraction?"</em> and the
other person replies <em>"Whoa, hmm, let me think more about this."</em> Then they go back and either give up,
because it does not work, or produce something that works, in theory, well with lambda abstraction,
but is otherwise quite unusable.</p>
<p>When working on <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-olympic-medalists">The Gamma project</a> and the
little <a href="github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-script">scripting language it runs</a>, I recently went through
a similar thinking process. Instead of letting lambda abstraction spoil the party <em>again</em>,
I think we need to think about different ways of code reuse.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-olympic-medalists/">The Gamma — Visualizing Olympic Medalists</a></h1>
    <p>Olympic Games are perfect opportunity to do a fun data visualization project - just like
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/happy-new-year-tweets/">New Year</a>, you can easily predict when they
will happen and you can get something interesting ready in advance. I used this year's
Games in Rio as a motivation to resume working on <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/">The Gamma
project</a>. If you did not read my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/">previous
article</a>,
the idea is to build tooling for open, reproducible and interactive data-driven storytelling.
When you see a visualization, not only you should be able to see how it has been created
(what data it uses &amp; how), but you should also be able to modify it, without much programming
experience, and look at other interesting aspects of the data.</p>
<p>The first version of The Gamma project tries to do some of this, using historical and current
data on Olympic medals as a sample dataset. You can play with the project at <a href="http://rio2016.thegamma.net/">The Gamma web
site</a>:</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are the most important links if you want to explore how it all works
on your own. However, continue reading and I'll describe the most important parts!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-script">TheGamma Script <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>
contains implementation of most of the client-side code. In particular, this includes compiler
for the language that is used to write the visualizations. It is written using <a href="http://fsharp.org">F#</a>
and <a href="https://fable-compiler.github.io/">Fable</a> and generates JavaScript using
<a href="http://babeljs.io/">Babel</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-olympics-web">TheGamma Olympics Web <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>
is a minimal web site that hosts the visualizations. You can find all the source code for
individual visualizations in <a href="https://github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-olympics-web/tree/master/docs">the docs folder</a>.
For example, see <a href="https://github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-olympics-web/blob/master/docs/medals-per-athlete.md">medals per athlete</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-script">TheGamma Services <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>
implements a server-side component that provides data for the client. This serves the
<a href="https://github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-services/blob/master/data/medals-expanded.csv">cleaned CSV data set</a>
using the <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/RestProvider/">REST Provider Protocol</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The project is still in early stages and the code needs more documentation (and ReadMe files, I
know!) However, if you would be interested in using it for something or you have some interesting
data to visualize, do not hesitate to ping me at <a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">@tomaspetricek</a>.
Also, thanks to the <a href="https://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/fund/">DNI Innovation Fund</a> for funding
the project and to the <a href="https://turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> for providing a place to work
on this over the coming months!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/">The Gamma and Digital News Innovation Fund</a></h1>
    <p>Last year, I wrote a bit about my interest in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/thegamma/">building programming tools for data
journalism</a>. Data journalism might sound like a niche
field, but that is not the case if we talk about data-driven storytelling more generally,</p>
<a href="https://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/">

<p>In programming, your outcome is typically some application that does stuff. In data science,
your outcome is very often a report or a <em>story</em> that aims to influence people's behavior or
company decisions. No matter whether you are a journalist writing an article about government
spending or an analyst producing internal sales reports, you are <em>telling stories with data</em>.</p>
<p>Being able to tell stories with data (but also verify and assess other people's stories that
can be backed by data) is becoming a vital skill in the modern world, which is partly why I find
this topic extremely important and interesting. But to do this currently, you need to be a
skilled programmer, great designer and good storyteller, all at the same time!</p>
<p>I have not written about this topic much over the last year (mainly because I was busy
with <a href="http://tomasp.net/coeffects">Coeffects</a>, <a href="http://www.fsharpconf.com">fsharpConf</a>,
<a href="http://fslab.org">FsLab</a> and <a href="http://www.fsharpworks.com">fsharpWorks</a>), but this will be
changing - I'm very happy to announce that my data-journalism related project
<a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma</a> has been awarded funding from the <a href="https://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/fund/">DNI Innovation
Fund</a> and I'll be working on it over the next year
at the <a href="https://turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> in London.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/philopl-questions/">Philosophical questions about programming</a></h1>
    <p>Combining philosophy and computer science might appear a bit odd. The disciplines have very little
overlap. Both philosophers and computer scientists get taught formal logic at some point in their
undergraduate courses, but that's probably as close as they get.</p>
<p>But the fact that the disciplines do not overlap much might very well be the reason why putting them
together is interesting. In an article about <a href="http://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/designandscience">Design and Science</a>,
Joichi Ito (from MIT Media Lab), describes the term <em>antidisciplinary</em> and nicely
summarizes why looking at such unusual combinations is worthwhile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interdisciplinary work is when people from different disciplines work together. But
<em>antidisciplinary</em> is something very different; it's about working in spaces that
simply do not fit into any existing academic discipline.</p>
<p>[When focusing on disciplines, it] takes more and more effort and resources to make a
unique contribution. While the space between and beyond the disciplines can be academically
risky, it (...) requires fewer resources to try promising, unorthodox
approaches; and provides the potential to have tremendous impact (...).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see from some of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/philosophy/">earlier blog posts</a>,
I think the space between philosophy and computer science is an interesting area. In this article,
I'll explain why. Unlike some of the previous posts (about <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/failures/index.html">miscomputation</a>,
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/against-types/index.html">types</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/index.html">philosophy of
science</a>), this post is quite broad and
does not go into much detail.</p>
<p>At the danger of sounding like a collection of random rants, I look at a number of
questions that arise when you look at computer science from the philosophical perspective,
but I won't attempt to answer them. You can see this article as a research proposal too -
and I hope to write more about some of the questions in the future.
I wish antidisciplinary work was more common and I believe looking
into such questions could have the tremendous impact that Joichi Ito mentioned.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/coeffects-playground/">Coeffects playground: Interactive essay based on my PhD thesis</a></h1>
    <p>In my <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/theses/coeffects/">PhD thesis</a>, I worked on integrating
<em>contextual information</em> into a type system of functional programming languages. For example,
say your mobile application accesses something from the environment such as GPS sensor or your
Facebook friends. With <em>coeffects</em>, this could be a part of the type. Rather than having type
<code>string -&gt; Person</code>, the type of a function would also include resources and would be
<code>string -{ gps, fb }-&gt; Person</code>. I wrote <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/why-coeffects-matter/">longer introduction to coeffects</a> on this
blog before.</p>
<p>As one might expect, the PhD thesis is more theoretical and it looks at other kinds of contextual
information (e.g. past values in stream-based data-flow programming) and it identifies abstract
<em>coeffect algebra</em> that captures the essence of contextual information that can be nicely tracked
in a functional language.</p>
<p>I always thought that the most interesting thing about the thesis is that it gives people a nice way
to think about <em>context</em> in a unified way. Sadly, the very theoretical presentation in the thesis
makes this quite hard for those who are not doing programming language theory.</p>
<p>To make it a bit easier to explore the ideas behind coeffects, I wrote a coeffect playground
that runs in a web browser and lets you learn about coeffects, play with two example context-aware languages,
run a couple of demos and learn more about how the theory works. Go <a href="http://tomasp.net/coeffects/">check it out now</a>
or continue below to learn more about some interesting internals!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/thegamma/">The Gamma: Simple code behind interactive articles</a></h1>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/thegamma/dj.png" style="float:right;width:300px"
  title="Illustration from 'The Data Journalism Handbook'" />
<p>There are huge amounts of data around us that we could use to better understand the world.
Every company collects large amounts of data about their sales or customers. Governments and
international organizations increasingly release interesting data sets to the public through
various <em>open government data</em> initiatives (<a href="http://data.gov">data.gov</a> or
<a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>). But raw data does not tell you much.</p>
<p>An interesting recent development is <em>data journalism</em>. Data journalists tell stories using
data. A data driven article is based on an interesting observation from the data, it includes
(interactive) visualizations that illustrate the point and it often allows the reader to get
the raw data.</p>
<p>Adding a chart produced in, say, Excel to an article is easy, but building good interactive
visualization is much harder. Ideally, the data driven article should not be just text with
static pictures, but a <em>program</em> that links the original data source to the visualization.
This lets readers explore how the data is used, update the content when new data is available
and change parameters of the visualization if they need to understand different aspect of the
topic.</p>
<p>This is in short what I'm trying to build with <a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma project</a>. If
you're interested in building better reports or data driven articles, continue reading!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/failures/">Miscomputation: Learning to live with errors</a></h1>
    <blockquote>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/failures/babbage.png" style="float:right;width:110px;margin:5px 0px 10px 20px" />
<p style="margin-bottom:5px">If trials of three or four simple cases have been made, and are found
to agree with the results given by the engine, it is scarcely possible that there can be any error
(...).</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Charles Babbage, On the mathematical<br /> powers of the calculating engine (1837)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anybody who has something to do with modern computers will agree that the above statement made by
Charles Babbage about the analytical engine is understatement, to say the least.</p>
<p>Computer programs do not always work as expected. There is a complex taxonomy of errors or
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-013-0112-0"><em>miscomputations</em></a>. The taxonomy of
possible errors is itself interesting. Syntax errors like missing semicolons are quite obvious
and are easy to catch. Logical errors are harder to find, but at least we know that something
went wrong. For example, our algorithm does not correctly sort some lists. There are also issues that
may or may not be actual errors. For example an algorithm in online store might suggest slightly
suspicious products. Finally, we also have concurrency errors that happen very rarely in some
very specific scenario.</p>
<p>If Babbage was right, we would just try three or four simple cases and eradicate all errors from
our programs, but eliminating errors is not so easy. In retrospect, it is quite interesting to
see how long it took early computer engineers to realise that coding (i.e. translating
mathematical algorithm to program code) errors are a problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom:5px">Errors in coding were only gradually recognized to be a signiﬁcant
problem: a typical early comment was that of Miller [circa 1949], who wrote that such errors,
along with hardware faults, could be "expected, in time, to become infrequent".</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Mark Priestley, Science of Operations (2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We <em>mostly</em> got rid of hardware faults, but coding errors are still here. Programmers spent
over 50 years finding different practical strategies for dealing with them. In this
blog post, I want to look at four of the strategies. Quite curiously, there is a very wide range.</p>
