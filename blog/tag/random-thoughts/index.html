<p>If you’re a registered member of the 
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FSharpLondon/" type="external">F#unctional Londoners</a> 
  user group, then you maybe already know that I'll be visiting London 
  on <strong>June 23</strong> and I’ll be talking about <strong>Reactive programming with F#</strong>. 
  If you're not a registered member and occasionally visit London, then you should definitely 
  register. The user group is organized by Carolyn Miller and <a href="http://www.trelford.com/blog/" type="external">Phil Trelford</a>
  (whom I met some time ago at Microsoft Research in Cambridge). Among others, previous speakers
  include <a href="http://strangelights.com/blog/" type="external">Robert Pickering</a> (who also 
  presented some samples based on my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">F# and Accelerator</a> series).
  Finally, another reason for joining the group is that it has a great name (as well as a logo)!</p>

<h2>When, what &amp; where?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/FSharpLondon/calendar/13501027/" type="external">Tomas Petricek on Reactive Programming with F#</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Date &amp; time:</strong> 23 June (Wednesday), 6:30 PM</li>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> The Skills Matter eXchange, 116-120 Goswell Road, London</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, I'll also have a free copy of my <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek" type="external">Real-World Functional Programming</a> book to give away during the talk!</p>
<h2>Reactive Programming with F#</h2>
<p>I'm sure you're already convinced to come. Nevertheless, you may still want to know 
  what I'm going to talk about. There are many areas where F# offers clear benefits such as
  parallel &amp; concurrent programming. I believe that <strong>reactive programming</strong>
  is another great area for F#. In reactive programming, we face quite different problems than
  in other programming styles. We (as the authors of the application) can no longer specify what
  the application should do. Instead, the application needs to be able to handle many possible
  combinations of events. This aspect of programming is sometimes called <em>inversion of control</em>.</p>
<p>Reactive programming is important for programming user interfaces, especially today when
  user interfaces are becoming more interactive and more "fancy". To demonstrate this, I'm working on some nice <strong>Silverlight</strong> demos for the talk! However, it is also needed
  to handle other kinds of events such as completion of background task or message from 
  other application. We'll look at the two essential techniques that F# provides for reactive
  programming:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Declarative event combinators</strong> - one way of writing reactive applications
    is to specify the whole event processing declaratively by saying "what" should be done with 
    occurrences of events. This is particularly useful when we need to encode simpler
    logic with a clear <em>data-flow</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Imperative using workflows</strong> - for more complicated interactions, we can
    use <em>asynchronous workflows</em>. This makes the code more explicit, but we get full 
    control over the <em>control-flow</em> of the application. Even though this approach is 
    more "imperative" it can be used for writing nicely composable functional code as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing you at the talk next week!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/excerpt-gui-workflows.aspx/">Programming user interfaces using F# workflows</a></h1>
    
<p>Numerous Manning partners already published several exceprts from my <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/" target="external">Real-World Functional Programming</a> book. You can find a list on the <a href="http://functional-programming.net/" type="external">book's web page</a>. However, the last excerpt published <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx" type="external">at DotNetSlackers</a> is particularly interesting. It discusses how to use F# asynchronous workflows to write GUI applications. This is a very powerful programming pattern that is very difficult to do in any other .NET language. We first discussed it with Don Syme during my internship at Microsoft Research and I found it very elegant, so I made some space for it in the book. In fact, the entire Chapter 16 discusses various reactive programming techniques that can be used in F#.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/excerpt-gui-workflows/app.png" style="margin:15px;float:right;" />
<p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">When designing applications that don't react to external events, you have lots of control flow constructs available, such as if-then-else expressions, for loops and while loops in imperative languages, or recursion and higher-order functions in functional languages. Constructs like this make it easy to describe what the application does. The control flow is clearly visible in the source code, so drawing a flowchart to describe it is straightforward.</p>

<p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">Understanding reactive applications is much more difficult. A typical C# application or GUI control that needs to react to multiple events usually involves mutable state. When an event occurs, it updates the state and may run more code in response to the event, depending on the current state. This architecture makes it quite difficult to understand the potential states of the application and the transitions between them. Using asynchronous workflows, we can write the code in a way that makes the control flow of the application visible even for reactive applications.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/book-deal.aspx/">Deal of the day: Real-World Functional Programming</a></h1>
    
<p>Some time ago, I received my copies of <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong>. I started working on it back in May 2008 and as many people who had more experience with writing books told me, it took longer than I was expecting! Anyway, I have to say, it was worth it, holding the actual printed book with my name on the cover is just fantastic!</p>
<br />
<a href="http://manning.com/petricek"><img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/book-deal/book.jpg" style="border:0px; float:right;margin:10px;" /></a>

<p>The goal of the book is to present functional programming concepts and ideas in a readable form. I wanted to create a book that will teach you how to <em>think functionally</em> without using the usual <em>shock therapy</em> that people usually feel when seeing functional programming for the first time. There are already a couple of reviews that suggest I was quite successful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Functional Programming for the Real World, by Tomas Petricek and Jon Skeet, has been a very helpful book for moving to F# from C#, as the authors do a fantastic job of helping to explain the differences between OOP and FP. </em><br />
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Real-World-Examples/dp/1933988924" type="external">James Black at Amazon.com</a>
  </li>
  <li><em>This book isn’t just a simple introduction to programming in F#; it’s an introductory text on functional programming covering the many reasons why it is time for this programming paradigm to finally be accepted by mainstream programmers. And it also contains much more... </em><br />
    <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/clivet/archive/2010/01/03/85227.aspx" type="external">CliveT, Software Engineer at Red Gate Software</a>
  </li>
  <li>... and there are many other great comments about the book at <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Manning book page</a>.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Deal of the day (January 24)</h2>
<p>Finally, here is one great news if you're interested in getting the book! <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong> is Manning's Deal of the Day this Sunday, January 24. On this day, the print book is available for $20 from the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Manning website</a>, with code <code>dotd0124</code>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/book-completed.aspx/">Real-World Functional Programming: Completed and printed!</a></h1>
    
<p>If you're following my blog or if you're interested in F# or functional programming in .NET, 
  you probably noticed that I was working on a book <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>.
  At some point, we called it <em>Functional Programming for the Real-World</em>, but then we changed the title back
  to a better sounding version <em>Real-World Functional Programming</em> (subtitle <em>With examples
  in F# and C#</em>). The book is also reason for a lower number of blog posts over the last year. Over the last 
  month or so, we were doing the final edits, reviewing the final PDF version (I fixed quite a lot minor 
  issues, synchronized book with the Beta 2 F# release and so on). Anyway, before a few days, I received the following 
  email (as an author, I receive the same emails as those who ordered the book through the <a href="http://www.manning.com/about/meap.html">Manning 
  Early Access Program</a>, so that I can see what we're sending to our dear readers):</p>

<table><tr><td>
<img style="margin:10px" src="/articles/book-completed/cover.png" />
</td><td>
<p style="font-style:italic; margin:10px 30px 10px 10px; text-indent:0px;">
Dear Tomas Petricek, <br />
We are pleased to announce that <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong> is now complete! As a MEAP subscriber 
you can download your copy of the finished ebook right now! (...) This ebook is the final version, 
identical to the softbound edition, which is currently being printed and will be available on <strong>December 24</strong>. 
If you chose the printed book option when you originally subscribed, we'll ship it to you automatically—no action required 
from you. </p>
</td></tr></table>

<h2>Finally finished!</h2>
<p>Yes, that's right. The book is finally completed and as far as I know, it has been printed last week! If you already 
  ordered the book, you won't receive it before Christmas, but it should come shortly after. I can't wait to see the
  book actually <em>printed</em>. The transition from the Word drafts I initially wrote to a final PDF version
  was already felt fantastic and I thought <em>"It looks like a real book!"</em> Among other things, there are now 
  graphical arrows with comments inside listings, which looks really great and makes code listings much easier to read.
  Now I can look forward to seeing the <em>actual book</em>. Maybe I'm too conservative, but I have to say that I'm 
  really glad that I wrote the book before everything is going to be published just electronically!</p>

<p>Here is a couple of links that you may found interesting if you want to look inside the book...</p>

</a>

<p>I already <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/book-source-available.aspx">mentioned</a> that I was doing my second internship
  with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" type="external">Don Syme</a> at Microsoft Research in Cambridge.
  This time, I was in Cambridge for 6 months from October until April, so it has been more than a month since 
  I left, but as you can guess I didn't have time to write anything about the internship until now... There isn't
  much to say though, because the internship was simply fantastic. Cambridge is a beautiful place (here are
  some <a href="http://cid-6ddff5260c96e30a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2008%20Autumn%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">autumn</a> and <a href="http://cid-6ddff5260c96e30a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2009%20Winter%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">winter</a> photos),
  the Microsoft Research lab in Cambridge is full of smart people, so it is a perferct working environment
  (except that you realize that you're not as clever as you think :-)). Also, it is just a few meters away from the
  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk" type="external">Computer Laboratory</a> of the Cambridge University, so there are always many 
  interesting talks and seminars. So, big thanks to Don Syme, James Margetson and everyone else who I had a chance 
  to work with during the internship.</p>
  
<p>One of the reasons why I didn't have much time to write about the internship earlier is that I
  was invited to the <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/" type="external">Lang.NET Symposium</a> shortly
  after the end of the internship. I had a chance to talk about my project there as well and there is
  even a video recording from the talk (the link is below), so you can watch it to find out more about my recent F# work.</p>

<p>As you can see, there has been quite a bit of silence on this blog for a while. 
  There are two reasons for that - the first is that I'm still working on the book 
  <a type="external" href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real World Functional
  Programming</a>, so all my writing activities are fully dedicated to the book. The second
  reason is that I'm having a great time doing an internship in the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/ppt">Programming Principles and Tools</a> group
  at Microsoft Research in Cambridge with the F# team and namely the F# language 
  designer <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" type="external">Don Syme</a>. 
  The photo on the left side is the entrance gate to the Trinity College of the Cambridge

  Live Gallery, so you can find more photos from Cambridge in my <a href="http://cid-8c3f26b4befe2dfa.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2009%20-%20Winter%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">online gallery</a>. Anyway,
  I just wanted to post a quick update with some information (and downloads!) related
  to the book...

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-programming-book.aspx/">Announcing: Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a></h1>
    
<p>If you’ve been reading my blog or seen some my articles, you know that I’m a big fan of the F# language and functional programming style. I’m also often trying to present a bit different view of C# and LINQ – for me it is interesting mainly because it brings many functional features to a main-stream language and allows using of many of the functional patterns in a real-world. Elegant way for working with data, which is the most commonly used feature of C# 3.0, is just one example of this functional approach. Talking about real-world applications of functional programming, there is also fantastic news about F#. It was announced last year that F# will become fully supported Visual Studio language and the first CTP version of F# was released this week!</p>

<p>I always thought that the topics mentioned in the previous paragraph are really interesting and that functional programming will continue to become more and more important. That’s why I’m really excited by the news that I’d like to announce today – I’m writing a book about functional programming in F# and C#....</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/webtools-thesis.aspx/">Thesis: Client-side Scripting using Meta-programming</a></h1>
    
<p>I realized that I haven’t yet posted a link to my Bachelor Thesis, which I partially worked on during my visit in Microsoft Research and which I successfully defended last year. The thesis is about a client/server web framework for F# called F# WebTools, which I already <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebtools-intro.aspx" type="external">mentioned here</a> and its abstract is following:</p>

<p style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-style:italic;">“Ajax” programming is becoming a de-facto standard for certain types of web applications, but unfortunately developing this kind of application is a difficult task. Developers have to deal with problems like a language impedance mismatch, limited execution runtime in web browser on the client-side and no integration between client and server-side parts that are developed as a two independent applications, but typically form a single and homogenous application. In this work we present the first project that deals with all three mentioned problems but which still integrates with existing web technologies such as ASP.NET on the server and JavaScript on the client. We use the F# language for writing both client and server-side part of the web application, which makes it possible to develop client-side code in a type-safe programming language using a subset of the F# library, and we provide a way to write both server-side and client-side code as a part of single homogeneous type defining the web page logic. The code is executed heterogeneously, part as JavaScript on the client, and part as native code on the server. Finally we use monadic syntax for the separation of client and server-side code, tracking this separation through the F# type system.</p>
