    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2025/adventure-calculus/">Choose Your Own Adventure Calculus</a></h1>
    <p>The rule of three suggests that if you encounter the same pattern for the third time in your
code, you should refactor it into a reusable abstraction. The same thing applies in programming
language theory. When you find that you are doing the same thing for the third time, it is
probably a good idea to stop and think - is there a general pattern?</p>
<div class="rdecor" style="max-width:400px;text-align:center">
<img src="https://tomasp.net/blog/2025/adventure-calculus/olympics.png" style="width:100%" />
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Auto-completion list showing possible operations in The Gamma</p>
</div>
<p>In my <a href="https://tomasp.net/academic/theses/coeffects/" title="Tomas Petricek (2017). Context-aware programming languages">PhD thesis on context-aware computations</a>, I did exactly this. When we realised
that liveness analysis, resource tracking and checking of data-flow computations all require
type system with similar structure, we came up with the idea of <em>coeffects</em>, which is an
abstraction that can capture all three (and so, you only need to add one mechanism for
tracking context into your language).</p>
<p>Recently, the same thing happened to me again. A lot of my work has been around interaction
with <a href="https://tomasp.net/techdims/" title="Joel Jakubovic, Jonathan Edwards, Tomas Petricek (2023). Technical dimensions of programming systems">programming systems</a>. I am interested in looking not just at the programming
languages, but also the stateful, interactive systems they are part of - and how programs are
created through interactive editor tools, gradually revised in notebook systems or how proofs
are created in interactive proof assistants. And interestingly, in three recent collaborations
around those ideas, we ended up finding a very similar pattern.</p>
<p>In multiple different systems, we encountered a pattern where the programming system
iteratively offers the user (programmer, data scientist, proof theoretician) a choice of
options that the user can choose from to construct or refine their program (see Figure 1).
In all systems, the user can also edit the code in other ways, but a lot (sometimes
everything!) can be done just by choosing options.</p>
<p>I now have three examples, so it is time to describe the general pattern. Earlier,
we called this (jokingly) dot-driven development, (seriously) AI assistants and (foolishly)
iterative prompting. For the lack of a better name, I will refer to the abstraction
as the <em>choose-your-own-adventure calculus</em>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2023/pompidou/">What can routers at Centre Pompidou teach us about software evolution?</a></h1>
    <p>Back in June, I was in Paris for the <a href="https://ncrafts.io/">NewCrafts conference</a> to talk about
<a href="https://vimeopro.com/newcrafts/newcrafts/video/842234359">the growing opacity of software systems</a>.
This was fun, partly because NewCrafts is a fantastic conference (you can already <a href="https://ncrafts.io/">get your
tickets</a> for 2024!) and also partly because my talk (arguing against many
established "good engineering" practices) was in many ways arguing for the exact opposite than
one of the keynotes, leading to many interesting conversations.</p>
<p>While in Paris, I also visited the <a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/">famous Centre Pompidou</a>.
Perhaps to the dismay of many modern art lovers, I spent a lot of time staring at the ceiling
looking for routers.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2023/vague-spaces/">Where programs live? Vague spaces and software systems</a></h1>
    <p>Architecture and urban planning have been a useful source of ideas for thinking about programming.
I have written <a href="https://tomasp.net/blog/tag/design/">various blog posts</a> and a paper
<a href="https://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/">Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning</a>
that argue why and explore some of those ideas. Like urban planning and architecture, the design of
any interesting software system deals with complex problems that can rarely be analysed in full and
with structures that will continue to evolve in unexpected ways after they are created.</p>
<p>My most recent reading on cities was a book <a href="https://www.academia.cz/mesto-naruby-2-dotisk--haluzik-radan--academia--2021">The City Inside Out</a>
(Czech only, unfortunately) that explore places referred to as <a href="https://www.atributosurbanos.es/en/terms/terrain-vague/">terrain vague</a>.
This term refers to unused and abandoned spaces that have lost their purpose or
do not have a clear use, but are used in various ways nevertheless. For various historical
reasons, there seem to be quite a few of such places in Prague (Figure 1) and, more generally,
Central European cities, which is the focus of the book.</p>
<p>The book is an interesting inspiration for thinking about programming in many ways.
It uses an inter-disciplinary approach ranging from history and philosophy to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoethnobotany">archaeobotany</a>, which is much needed for thinking
about programming too. (Not archeobotany, but inter-disciplinary thinking certainly!)
More specifically, it makes you think about the concept of a <em>space</em> in
which cities and programs exist, how the spaces inhabited by the two differ, what would it look
like if they were different and what structures get created in those spaces as a result of
social and technical forces.</p>

<p style="max-width:260px"><b>Figure 1.</b> The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander</p>
</div>
<p>Many programmers know the name of the architect Christopher Alexander for his work on
<em>design patterns</em> that has been adapted into the world of programming. A lot of people
know of the, sometimes ridiculed, patterns like strategy (functions!) or visitor (pattern
matching!) and some have read the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Cd7sBv" title="Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software - Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides">Gang of Four design patterns book</a> that introduced them.
A few people know of the <a href="https://dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf" title="Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community - Richard P. Gabriel">Patterns of Software</a> book by Richard P. Gabriel, which is a much more
profound reflection on software inspired by the work of Christopher Alexander. And almost
nobody has actually read Christopher Alexander's books. (Thanks in advance for reminding me
on <a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">Twitter</a> that I am mistaken...)</p>
<p>I read Alexander's <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2" title="Notes on the Synthesis of Form - Christopher Alexander">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a> a couple of years ago, and used
it as one of the sources for ideas in my recent Onward! essay on <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/" title="Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning - Tomas Petricek">architecture, design and urban
planning</a>, but I did not know his other work. Only recently, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/29/christopher-alexander-obituary">Christopher Alexander
died</a>,
I finally ordered two books that are most directly about design patterns,
<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">The Timeless Way of Building</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3wecpGG" title="A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction - Christopher Alexander">A Pattern Language</a>.</p>
<p>This post is a somewhat unorganized collection of thoughts triggered by reading of The Timeless
Way of Building, including my understanding of Alexander's work, some critical thoughts
and on the applications of his ideas to software.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2022/no-code-substrates/">No-code, no thought? Substrates for simple programming for all</a></h1>
    <div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center">

<p style="max-width:350px"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Virtually eliminates your coding load. FLOW-MATIC promotional
brochure (1957)</p>
</div>
<p>No-code is a hot new topic for programming startups. The idea is to develop a system
that allows end-users to do the programming they need without the difficult task of writing
code. There are no-code systems for building mobile apps, analysing data and many more.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not a surprise that "eliminating programming load" is not as new idea as some
people may think and there is an excellent blog series on <a href="https://instadeq.com/blog/categories/history/" title="No-code history - Instadeq Blog - No-code Data Analysis &amp; Interactive Visualizations">no-code history by Instadeq</a>,
going back to 1959.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the 1957 <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102646140" title="Introducing a New Language for Automatic Programming Univac Flow-Matic">promotional brochure about FLOW-MATIC</a>,
a predecessor to COBOL created by Grace Hopper, uses almost the same language that you will
find in startup pitch decks today (Figure 1). Of course, in 1957, coding referred to the
tedious process of transcribing the desired program to low-level assembler or (more often)
directly to machine code and "virtually eliminating your coding load" meant having a symbolic
high-level programming language so easy that a reasonably skilled mathematician would be able
to use it.</p>
<p>So, is there really anything new about no-code systems? Is it really possible to "eliminate
your programming load"? And what would it really take to make some real progress in that direction?</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/popup-from-hell/">Pop-up from Hell: On the growing opacity of web programs</a></h1>
    <p>I started to learn how to program in high school at the end of the 1990s using a mix of BASIC, Turbo
Pascal and HTML with JavaScript. The seed for this blog post comes from my experience with learning
how to program in JavaScript, without having much guidance or organized resources. This article continues
a theme that I started in my <a href="http://tomasp.net/commodore64">interactive Commodore 64 article</a>,
which is to look at past programming systems and see what interesting past ideas have been lost
in contemporary systems. Unlike with Commodore 64, which I first used in 2018 in the
Seattle Living Computers museum, my perspective on the Early Web may be biased by personal
experience. I will do my best to not make this post sound like a grumbling of an old nerd!
(I thought this only comes later, but I may have been wrong...)</p>
<div class="rdecor"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/popup-from-hell/close-me.gif" style="max-width:400px" /></div>
<p>The 1990s, the web had a fair amount of quirky web pages, often created just for fun. The GeoCities
hosting service, which has <a href="http://www.oocities.org">partly been archived</a> is a witness of this
and there are even academic books, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/2YiEUVe">Dot-Com Design</a> documenting
this history.</p>
<p>Some of the quirky things that you could do with JavaScript included creating roll-over effects
(making an image change when mouse pointer is over it), creating an animation that follows the
cursor as it moves and, of course, annoying the users with all sorts of pop-up windows for both
entertaining and advertising purposes. Annoying pop-ups will be the starting point for my blog
post, but I'll be using those to make a more general and interesting point about how programs
evolve to become more opaque.</p>
<p><em>This blog post is based on a talk <a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/Talks/2021/popup-from-hell/">Popup from hell: Reflections on the most annoying 1990s
program</a> that I did recently at an
(in person!) meeting of the <a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/">PROGRAMme project</a>. Thanks to

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/software-designers/">Software designers, not engineers: An interview from alternative universe</a></h1>
    <p>While the physicists investigate the nature of the mysterious portal that has recently appeared in
North London, several human beings recently came through the portal, which appears to be a
gate into an alternative universe. As we understood from the last two people coming through the
portal, it seems to be a linked with a universe that is in many ways like ours, reached about the
same level of social and technological development, but differs in numerous curious details.
The paths through which people in this alternative universe reached similar results as our world
are often subtly different.</p>
<div class="rdecor"><a href="https://amzn.to/3x0Ww5a"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/software-designers/ways.png" style="max-width:260px" /></a></div>
<p>The most recent visitor from the alternative universe is Ms Zaha Atkinson, who would most likely
be titled <em>software engineer</em> in our world, although the title she uses in her home world is
<em>software designer</em>. She is a well-known software designer and has been also titled using the
strange-sounding title <em>softwarenova</em>, a label that we will soon say more about. As with other
technological and societal developments, the alternative universe seems to have arrived at very
similar results as our worlds. Software is eating the (alternative) world, but it is built in very
different ways. The interview with Ms Zaha Atkinson, presented below, reveals how very different
the world of software is when we think of programmers as software <em>designers</em> rather than as
software <em>engineers</em>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/learning-and-programming/">Is deep learning a new kind of programming? Operationalistic look at programming</a></h1>
    <p>In most discussions about how to make programming better, someone eventually says
something along the lines of <em>"we'll just have to wait until deep learning solves
the problem!"</em> I think this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">naively optimistic idea</a>,
but it raises one interesting question: In what sense are programs created using deep
learning a <em>different kind</em> of programs than those written by hand?</p>
<div class="rdecor">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/learning-and-programming/bridgman.jpg" style="max-width:350px"/>
</div>
<p>This question recently arose in discussions that we have been having as part of the
<a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/">PROGRAMme project</a>, which explores historical and
philosophical perspectives on the question "What is a (computer) program?" and so this
article owes much debt to <a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/members">others involved in the project</a>,
especially Maël Pégny, Liesbeth De Mol and Nick Wiggershaus.</p>
<p>Many people will intuitively think that, if you train a deep neural network to solve some
a problem, you get a different kind of program than if you manually write some logic to solve
the problem. But what exactly is the difference? In both cases, the program is a sequence of
instructions that are deterministically executed by a machine, one after another, to produce
the result.</p>
<p>When reading the excellent book <a href="https://amzn.to/2SvTwKT" title="Hasok Chang (2004). Inventing Temperature: Measurement and Scientific Progress">Inventing Temperature</a> by Hasok
Chang recently, I came across the idea of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/operationalism/" title="Hasok Chang (2019). Operationalism, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy">operationalism</a>,
which I believe provides a useful perspective for thinking about the issue of deep learning and
programming. The operationalist point of view was introduced by a physicist Percy Williams Bridgman. To
quote: <em>we mean by any concept nothing more than a set of operations; the concept is synonymous
with the corresponding set of operations</em>. What does this tell us about deep learning and programming?</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/data-exploration-calculus/">Data exploration calculus: Capturing the essence of exploratory data scripting</a></h1>
    <p>Most real-world programming languages are too complex to be studied using formal methods.
For this reason, academics often work with simple theoretical languages instead. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">λ-calculus</a>
is a simple formal language that is often used for talking about functional languages, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">π-calculus</a>
is a model of concurrent programming and there is an entire book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8598-9">A Theory of Objects</a>
modelling various object-oriented systems.</p>
<div class="rdecor"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/data-exploration-calculus/ft.gif" style="width:360px"/><br/><p style="width:360px;line-height:20px;margin-top:10px;text-align:center;"><small>Animation from Financial Times article "Why the world's recycling system stopped working".</small></p></div>
<p>Those calculi try to capture the most interesting aspect of the programming language. This is
function application in functional programming, sending of messages in concurrent programming
and object construction with inheritance in object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been working on programming tools for data exploration.
In particular, I'm interested in the kind of programming that journalists need to do when
they work with data. A good example is the coding done for the
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8">Why the world's recycling system stopped working</a>
article by Financial Times, which is <a href="https://github.com/ft-interactive/recycling-is-broken-notebooks">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Although data journalists and other data scientists use regular programming languages like
Python, the kind of code they write is very different from the kind of code you need to write
when building a library or a web application in Python.</p>
<p>In a paper <a href="https://programming-journal.org/2020/4/8/">Foundations of a live data exploration environment</a>
that was published in February 2020 in the open access <a href="https://programming-journal.org/">Programming Journal</a>,
I wanted to talk about some interesting work that I've been doing on live previews in
<a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma</a>. For this, I needed a small model of my programming language.</p>
<p>In the end the most interesting aspect of the paper is the definition of the
<em>data exploration calculus</em>, a small programming language that captures the kind of code
that data scientists write to explore data. This looks quite different from,
say, a λ-calculus and π-calculus. It should be interesting not only if you're planning to do
theoretical programming language research about data scripting, but also because
it captures some of the atypical properties of the programs that data scientists write...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2019/first-language/">What to teach as the first programming language and why</a></h1>
    <p>The number of Google search results for the phrase
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=" title="choosing+the+first+programming+language">"choosing the first programming language"</a>
at the time of writing is 15,800. This illustrates just how debated the issue of choosing the first
programming language is. In this blog post, I will not actually try to answer the question posed
in the title of the post. I will not discuss what language we should teach as the first one.
Instead, I will look at a more interesting question.</p>
<p>I will investigate the arguments that are used in favour of or against particular programming
languages in computer science curriculum. I am more interested in the kind of argumentation that
is employed to support a particular choice than in the specific languages involved. This approach is
valuable for two reasons. First, by looking at the argumentation used, we can learn what educators
consider important about computer science. Second, understanding the motivations behind different
arguments allows us to make our own debates about the choice of a programming language more informed.</p>
<p>The scope of this blog post is limited to the choice of the first programming language taught in an
undergraduate computer science programmes at universities. This means that I will not discuss other
important contexts such as choices at a primary or a secondary education level, choices for
independent learners and choices in other university degrees that might involve programming.</p>
<p>Note that this blog post is adapted from an essay that I wrote as part of a
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/teaching/qualifications/pgche/">Postgrduate Certificate for Higher Education programme</a>
at University of Kent, so it assumes less knowledge about programming than a typical reader of
my blog has. This makes it accessible to a broader audience thinking about education
though!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/programming-interaction/">Programming as interaction: A new perspective for programming language research</a></h1>
    <p>In May, I joined the <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/">School of Computing</a> at the <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of
Kent</a> as a Lecturer (equivalent of Assistant Professor in some other countries).
When applying for the job, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to best explain the kind of
research that I would like to do. This blog post is a brief summary of my ideas. I'm interested
in way too many things, including <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/philosophy/">philosophy and design</a> and
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/data-journalism/">data journalism</a>, but this post will be mainly about
programming language research. After all, I'm a member of the <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/research/groups/plas/">Programming Languages
and Systems group</a>!</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/programming-interaction/kent.png" class="rdecor-sm" style="max-width:250px"/>
<p>Unlike some of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thinking-unthinkable/">other posts about programming languages</a>,
I won't try to convince you that we should be studying programming languages completely differently this
time. Instead, I want to describe <em>one simple trick that will make current programming language
research much more interesting</em>!</p>
<p>A lot of programming language papers today talk about programs and program properties. In
statically typed programming languages, we can check that a program <span class="math">\(e\)</span> has certain type <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>,
which means that, when the program is run, it will only produce values of the type.
This is very nice, but it misses a fundamental thing about programming. How was this program
<span class="math">\(e\)</span> actually constructed?</p>
<p>When programming, you spend most of your time working with programs that are <em>unfinished</em>. This
means that they do not do what they are supposed to be (eventually) doing and, very often, they
are not well-typed or even syntactically invalid. However, that does not mean that we can afford
to ignore them. In many cases, programmers can even run those programs (using REPL or using a
notebook environment). In other words, programming language research should not study <em>programs</em>,
but should instead study <em>programming</em>!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/alien-lambda-calculus/">Would aliens understand lambda calculus?</a></h1>
    <p>Unless you are a sci-fi author or some secret government agency, the question whether aliens
would understand lambda calculus is probably not your main practical concern. However, the question
is intriguing because it nicely vividly formulates a fundamental question about our formal mathematical
knowledge. Are mathematical theories and results about them <em>invented</em>, i.e. constructed by
humans, or <em>discovered</em>, i.e. are they eternal truths that exist regardless of whether there are
humans to know them?</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/alien-lambda-calculus/human.jpg" class="rdecor"
    style="width:40%;max-width:400px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" />
<p>The question makes for a fantastic late night pub debate, but how can we go about answering it using
a more serious methodology? Is there a paper one can read to better understand the problem?
Occasionally, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R&amp;v=IOiZatlZtGU">talk</a>
or an <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-aliens-have-LISP-or-Scheme">online comment</a>
by a computer scientist comments on this question, but way too often, people miss the fact that
the nature of mathematical entities is one of the fundamental questions of <em>philosophy of
mathematics</em>. Alas, all those discussions are carefully hidden in the humanities department!</p>
<p>I believe that knowing a bit about philosophy of mathematics is important if we want to have a
meaningful debate about philosophical questions of mathematics (sic!) and so I did a talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoWH2jNlvQQ">on this very subject at CodeMesh 2017</a>.
This article is slightly refined and hopefully
more polished version of the talk for those who, like me, prefer reading over watching.
Keep in mind that the question about the nature of mathematical entities is one of the fundamental
questions of an <em>entire academic discipline</em>. As such, this article cannot possibly cover all the
relevant discussions. Compared to some other writings in this space, this article is, at least,
based on a couple of philosophical books that, I believe, have useful things to say on the subject!</p>

<p>The word "design" is often used when talking about programming languages. In fact, it even made
it into the name of one of the most prestigious academic programming conferences, <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/PLDI/">Programming
Language Design and Implementation (PLDI)</a>. Yet, it is
almost impossible to come across a paper about programming languages that uses design methods to
study its subject. We intuitively feel that "design" is an important aspect of programming
languages, but we never found a way to talk about it and instead treat programming languages as
mathematical puzzles or as engineering problems.</p>
<p>This is a shame. Applying design thinking, in the sense used in applied arts, can let us talk
about, explore and answer important questions about programming languages that are ignored when
we limit ourselves to mathematical or engineering methods. I think the programming language
community is, perhaps unconsciously, aware of this - one of the reviews of <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/fsharp-data/">my recent PLDI
paper</a> said <em>"this is a nice, novel design paper,
and the community often wants more design papers in our conferences"</em>. The problem is that we
we do not know how to write and evaluate work that follows design methodology.</p>
<p>To better understand how design works, I recently read <a href="http://amzn.to/2gVxn8W">The Philosophy of Design</a>
by Glenn Parsons. The book perhaps did not answer many of my questions about design, but it did give
me a number of ideas about what design is, what questions it can explore and how those could be
relevant for the study of programming languages...</p>

    <p>Over the last year, I have been working on <a href="http://thegamma.net/">The Gamma project</a>, which aims
to make data-driven visualizations more trustworthy and to enable large number of people to
build visualizations backed by data. The Gamma makes it possible to create visualizations that
are built on trustworthy primary data sources such as the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org">World Bank</a>
and you can provide your own <a href="http://thegamma.net/publishing/">data source by writing a REST service</a>.</p>
<p>A great piece of feedback that I got when talking about The Gamma is that this is a nice ultimate
goal, but it makes it hard for people to start with The Gamma. If you do not want to use the World
Bank data and you're not a developer to write your own REST service, how do you get started?</p>

<p>To make starting with The Gamma easier, the gallery now has a <a href="https://gallery.thegamma.net/create">new four-step getting started page</a>
where you can upload your data as a CSV file or paste it from Excel spreadsheet and create nice

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/thegamma-package/">The Gamma dataviz package now available!</a></h1>
    <p>There were a lot of rumors recently about <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37995600">the death of facts</a>
and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/19/crisis-of-statistics-big-data-democracy">the death of statistics</a>.
I believe the core of the problem is that working with facts is quite tedious and the results are
often not particularly exciting. Social media made it extremely easy to share your own opinions
in an engaging way, but what we are missing is a similarly easy and engaging way to share facts
backed by data.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/thegamma-package/npm.png" style="width:200px" class="rdecor-sm"/>
</a>
<p>This is, in essence, the motivation for The Gamma project that I've been <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/">working on
recently</a>. After several experiments, including the
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-olympic-medalists/">visualization of Olympic medalists</a>,
I'm now happy to share the first reusable component based on the work that you can try and use
in your data visualization projects. If you want to get started:</p>

<li><a href="http://thegamma.net/developers/">How to use thegamma-script in your projects</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The package implements a simple scripting language that anyone can use for writing simple data
aggregation and data exploration scripts. The tooling for the scripting language makes it super
easy to create and modify existing data analyses. Editor auto-complete offers all available
operations and a spreadsheet-inspired editor lets you create scripts without writing code - yet,
you still get a transparent and reproducible script as the result.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/no-functions/">Can programming be liberated from function abstraction?</a></h1>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/no-functions/lambda.png" style="width:180px" class="rdecor" />
<p>When you start working in the programming language theory business, you'll soon find out that
lambda abstraction and functions break many nice ideas or, at least, make your life very hard.
For example, type inference is easy if you only have <code>var x = ...</code>, but it gets hard once you
want to infer type of <code>x</code> in something like <code>fun x -&gt; ...</code> because we do not know what is
assigned to <code>x</code>. Distributed programming is another example - sending around data is easy, but
once you start sending around function values, things become hard.</p>
<p>Every programming language researcher soon learns this trick. When someone tells you about a nice
idea, you reply <em>"Interesting... but how does this interact with lambda abstraction?"</em> and the
other person replies <em>"Whoa, hmm, let me think more about this."</em> Then they go back and either give up,
because it does not work, or produce something that works, in theory, well with lambda abstraction,
but is otherwise quite unusable.</p>
<p>When working on <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-olympic-medalists">The Gamma project</a> and the
little <a href="github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-script">scripting language it runs</a>, I recently went through
a similar thinking process. Instead of letting lambda abstraction spoil the party <em>again</em>,
I think we need to think about different ways of code reuse.</p>

    <p>In my <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/theses/coeffects/">PhD thesis</a>, I worked on integrating
<em>contextual information</em> into a type system of functional programming languages. For example,
say your mobile application accesses something from the environment such as GPS sensor or your
Facebook friends. With <em>coeffects</em>, this could be a part of the type. Rather than having type
<code>string -&gt; Person</code>, the type of a function would also include resources and would be
<code>string -{ gps, fb }-&gt; Person</code>. I wrote <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/why-coeffects-matter/">longer introduction to coeffects</a> on this
blog before.</p>
<p>As one might expect, the PhD thesis is more theoretical and it looks at other kinds of contextual
information (e.g. past values in stream-based data-flow programming) and it identifies abstract
<em>coeffect algebra</em> that captures the essence of contextual information that can be nicely tracked
in a functional language.</p>
<p>I always thought that the most interesting thing about the thesis is that it gives people a nice way
to think about <em>context</em> in a unified way. Sadly, the very theoretical presentation in the thesis
makes this quite hard for those who are not doing programming language theory.</p>
<p>To make it a bit easier to explore the ideas behind coeffects, I wrote a coeffect playground
that runs in a web browser and lets you learn about coeffects, play with two example context-aware languages,
run a couple of demos and learn more about how the theory works. Go <a href="http://tomasp.net/coeffects/">check it out now</a>
or continue below to learn more about some interesting internals!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/reading-list/">Philosophy of science books every computer scientist should read</a></h1>
    <p>When I tell my fellow computer scientists or software developers that I'm interested in
<em>philosophy of science</em>, they first look a bit confused, then we have a really interesting
discussion about it and then they ask me for some interesting books they could read about it.
Given that Christmas is just around the corner and some of the readers might still be looking
for a good present to get, I thought that now is the perfect time to turn my answer into a
blog post!</p>
<p>So, what is philosophy of science about? In summary, it is about trying to better understand
science. I'll keep using the word <em>science</em> here, but I think <em>engineering</em> would work equally
well. As someone who recently spent a couple of years doing a PhD on programming language theory,
I find this extremely important for computer science (and programming). How can we make better
programming languages if we do not know what <em>better</em> means? And what do we mean when we talk
about very basic concepts like <em>types</em> or programming <em>errors</em>?</p>
<p>Reading about philosophy of science inspired me to write a couple of essays on some of the
topics above including <a href="/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/">What can programming language research learn from the philosophy of science?</a> and two essays that discuss the <a href="/blog/2015/against-types/">nature of types in programming languages</a> and also
the nature of <a href="/blog/2015/failures/">errors and miscomputations</a>. This blog post lists some of
the interesting books that I've read and that influenced my thinking (not just) when writing the
aforementioned essays.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/typed-revisited/">In the age of the web: Typed functional-first programming revisited</a></h1>
    <p>Most programming languages were designed before the age of web.
This matters because the web changes many assumptions that typed functional
language designers tak for granted. For example, programs do not run in a
<em>closed world</em>, but must instead interact with (changing and likely unreliable)
services and data sources, communication is often asynchronous or event-driven,
and programs need to interoperate with untyped environments like JavaScript
libraries.</p>
<p>How can statically-typed programming languages adapt to the modern world?
In this article, I look at one possible answer that is inspired by the F#
language and various F# libraries. In F#, we use <em>type providers</em> for
integration with external information sources and for integration with untyped
programming environments. We use <em>lightweight meta-programming</em> for targeting
JavaScript and <em>computation expressions</em> for writing asynchronous code.</p>
<p>This blog post is a shorter version of a <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/age-of-web/">ML workshop paper</a>
that I co-authored earlier this year and you should see this more as a position
statement. I'm not sure if F# and the solutions shown here are the best ones,
but I think they highlight very important questions in programming language
design that I very much see as unsolved.</p>
<p>The article has two sections. First, I'll go through a simple case study showing
how F# can be used to build a client-side web widget. Then, I'll discuss some
of the implications for programming language design based on the example.</p>

(...).</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Charles Babbage, On the mathematical<br /> powers of the calculating engine (1837)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anybody who has something to do with modern computers will agree that the above statement made by
Charles Babbage about the analytical engine is understatement, to say the least.</p>
<p>Computer programs do not always work as expected. There is a complex taxonomy of errors or
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-013-0112-0"><em>miscomputations</em></a>. The taxonomy of
possible errors is itself interesting. Syntax errors like missing semicolons are quite obvious
and are easy to catch. Logical errors are harder to find, but at least we know that something
went wrong. For example, our algorithm does not correctly sort some lists. There are also issues that
may or may not be actual errors. For example an algorithm in online store might suggest slightly
suspicious products. Finally, we also have concurrency errors that happen very rarely in some
very specific scenario.</p>
<p>If Babbage was right, we would just try three or four simple cases and eradicate all errors from
our programs, but eliminating errors is not so easy. In retrospect, it is quite interesting to
see how long it took early computer engineers to realise that coding (i.e. translating
mathematical algorithm to program code) errors are a problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom:5px">Errors in coding were only gradually recognized to be a signiﬁcant
problem: a typical early comment was that of Miller [circa 1949], who wrote that such errors,
along with hardware faults, could be "expected, in time, to become infrequent".</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Mark Priestley, Science of Operations (2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We <em>mostly</em> got rid of hardware faults, but coding errors are still here. Programmers spent
over 50 years finding different practical strategies for dealing with them. In this
blog post, I want to look at four of the strategies. Quite curiously, there is a very wide range.</p>

<p>Programming languages are a fascinating area because they combine computer science (and logic) with
many other disciplines including <a href="http://lmeyerov.github.io/projects/socioplt/viz/index.html">sociology</a>, <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1415/P201/">human computer interaction</a> and things
that cannot be scientifically quantified like intuition, taste and (for better or worse) politics.</p>
<p>When we talk about programming languages, we often treat it mainly as scientific discussion seeking
some objective truth. This is not surprising - science is surrounded by an aura of perfection and
so it is easy to think that focusing on the core scientific essence (and leaving out everything)
else is the right way of looking at programming languages.</p>
<p>However this leaves out many things that make programming languages interesting. I believe that one
way to fill the missing gap is to look at philosophy of science, which can help us understand how
programming language research is done and how it should be done. I wrote about the general idea
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/">in a blog post (and essay) last year</a>. Today, I want to talk about one specific topic: <em>What
is the meaning of types?</em></p>
<p>This blog post is a shorter (less philosophical and more to the point) version of an essay that
I submitted to <a href="http://2015.splashcon.org/track/onward2015-essays">Onward! Essays 2015</a>. If you want to get a quick peek at the ideas in the
essay, then continue reading here! If you want to read the full essay (or save it for later),

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/update-monads/">Stateful computations in F# with update monads</a></h1>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/update-monads/code.png" style="float:right;margin:20px;width:200px" />
<p>Most discussions about monads, even in F#, start by looking at the well-known standard
monads for handling state from Haskell. The <em>reader</em> monad gives us a way to propagate
some read-only state, the <em>writer</em> monad makes it possible to (imperatively) produce
values such as logs and the <em>state</em> monad encapsulates state that can be read and changed.</p>
<p>These are no doubt useful in Haskell, but I never found them as important for F#.
The first reason is that F# supports state and mutation and often it is just easier
to use a mutable state. The second reason is that you have to implement three
different computation builders for them. This does not fit very well with the F# style
where you need to name the computation explicitly, e.g. by writing <code>async { ... }</code>
(See also my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/computation-zoo-padl">recent blog about the F# Computation Zoo paper</a>).</p>
<p>When visiting the Tallinn university in December (thanks to James Chapman, Juhan Ernits
&amp; Tarmo Uustalu for hosting me!), I discovered the work on <em>update monads</em> by Danel Ahman
and Tarmo Uustalu on <a href="http://cs.ioc.ee/~tarmo/papers/types13.pdf">update monads</a>, which elegantly unifies <em>reader</em>, <em>writer</em> and
<em>state</em> monads using a single abstraction.</p>
<p>In this article, I implement the idea of <em>update monads</em> in F#. Update monads are
parameterized by <em>acts</em> that capture the operations that can be done on the state.
This means that we can define just a single computation expression <code>update { ... }</code>
and use it for writing computations of all three aforementioned kinds.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/">What can programming language research learn from the philosophy of science?</a></h1>
    <p>As someone doing programming language research, I find it really interesting to think
about <em>how</em> programming language research is done, how it has been done in the past
and how it <em>should</em> be done. This kind of questions are usually asked by philosophy
of science, but only a few people have discussed this in the context of computing
(or even programming languages).</p>
<p>So, my starting point was to look at the classic works in the general philosophy of science
and see which of these could tell us something about programming languages.</p>
<p>I wrote an article about some of these ideas and presented it last week at the
second symposium on <a href="http://www.computing-conference.ugent.be/hapop2">History and Philosophy of Programming</a>.
For me, it was amazing to talk with interesting people working on so many great
related ideas! Anyway, now that the paper has been published and I did a talk, I should
also share it on my blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/philosophy-pl/index.html">What can Programming Language Research Learn from the Philosophy of 
Science?</a>
</li>
<li>
Fairly minimalistic <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/philosophy-pl/philosophy-pl-aisb.pdf">slides from my talk at the 
symposium</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One feedback that I got when I submitted the paper to Onward! Essays last year was that
the paper uses a lot of philosophy of science terminology. This was partly the point of
the paper, but the feedback inspired me to write a more readable overview in a form of
blog post. So, if you want to get a quick peek at some of the ideas, you can also read
this short blog (and then perhaps go back to the paper)!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/why-coeffects-matter/">Coeffects: The next big programming challenge</a></h1>
    <p>Many advances in programming language design are driven by some practical motivations.
Sometimes, the practical motivations are easy to see - for example, when they come from
some external change such as the rise of multi-core processors. Sometimes, discovering
the practical motivations is a tricky task - perhaps because everyone is used to a
certain way of doing things that we do not even <em>see</em> how poor our current solution is.</p>
<p>The following two examples are related to the work done in F# (because this is what
I'm the most familiar with), but you can surely find similar examples in other languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-core</strong> is an easy to see challenge caused by an external development.
It led to the popularity of <em>immutable</em> data structures (and functional programming,
in general) and it was also partly motivation for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233250.aspx" title="Asynchronous Workflows (F#)">asynchronous workflows</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data access</strong> is a more subtle challenge. Technologies like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397926.aspx" title="LINQ (Language-Integrated Query)">LINQ</a> make it
significantly easier, but it was not easy to see that inline SQL was a poor solution.
This is even more the case for F# <em>type providers</em>. You will not realize how poor the
established data access story is until you <em>see</em> something like
the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCuGgA9Yqrs" title="F# R Type Provider Demo">WorldBank and R provider</a> or <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html" title="F# Data: CSV type provider">CSV type provider</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that the next important practical challenge for programming language designers
is of the kind that is not easy to see - because we are so used to doing things in
certain ways that we cannot see how poor they are. The problem is designing languages
that are better at working with (and understanding) the <em>context</em> in which programs are
executed.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/computation-zoo-padl/">The F# Computation Expression Zoo (PADL'14)</a></h1>
    <p>F# <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233182.aspx">computation expressions</a> are the
syntactic language mechanism that is used by features like sequence expressions and asynchronous
workflows. The aim of F# computation expressions is to provide a <em>single</em> syntactic mechanism
that provides convenient notation for writing a wide range of computations.</p>
<p>The syntactic mechanisms that are unified by computation expressions include Haskell <code>do</code>
notation and list comprehensions, C# iterators, asynchronous methods and LINQ queries,
Scala <code>for</code> comprehensions and Python generators to name just a few.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I started working on an academic article to explain what makes computation
expressions unique - and I think there is quite a few interesting aspects. Sadly, this is
often not very well explained and so the general perception is more like this...</p>

    <img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/types-and-maths/distributivity.png" class="rdecor" />
<p>One of the most amazing aspects of mathematics is that it applies to such a wide range
of areas. The same mathematical rules can be applied to completely different objects
(say, forces in physics or markets in economics) and they work exactly the same way.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll look at one such fascinating use of mathematics - we'll use
elementary school algebra to reason about functional data types.</p>
<p>In functional programming, the best way to start solving a problem is to think about
the data types that are needed to represent the data that you will be working with.
This gives you a simple starting point and a great tool to communicate and
develop your ideas. I call this approach <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx">Type-First Development and I wrote about
it earlier</a>, so I won't repeat
that here.</p>
<p>The two most elementary types in functional languages are <em>tuples</em> (also called pairs
or product types) and <em>discriminated unions</em> (also called algebraic data types, case
classes or sum types). It turns out that these two types are closely related to
<em>multiplication</em> and <em>addition</em> in algebra...</p>

    <p>One of the less frequently advertised new features in F# 3.0 is the <em>query syntax</em>.
It is an extension that makes it possible to add custom operations in an F#
computation expression. The standard <code>query { .. }</code> computation uses this to define
operations such as sorting (<code>sortBy</code> and <code>sortByDescending</code>) or operations for taking
and skipping elements (<code>take</code>, <code>takeWhile</code>, ...). For example, you can write:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
<span class="l">2: </span>

<p>In this article I'll use the same notation for processing trees using the <em>zipper</em>
pattern. I'll show how to define a computation that allows you to traverse a tree
and perform transformations on (parts) of the tree. For example, we'll be able to
say "Go to the left sub-tree, multiply all values by 2. Then go back and to the
right sub-tree and divide all values by 2" as follows:</p>

<p>This example behaves quite differently to the usual <code>query</code> computation. It mostly
relies on custom operations like <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>up</code> that allow us to navigate
through a tree (descend along the left or right sub-tree, go back to the parent node).
The only operation that <em>does something</em> is the <code>map</code> operation which transforms the
current sub-tree.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/applicative-functors.aspx/">Applicative functors: definition and syntax</a></h1>
    
<p>In a recent blog post, <a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/08/applicative-functors/" title="Edward Z. Yang: Applicative functors">Edward Z. Yang talks about applicative functors</a>. 
He mentions two equivalent definitions of applicative functors - the standard
definition used in Haskell libraries (<code>Applicative</code>) and an alternative that
has been also presented in the <a href="http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html" title="C. McBride and R. Paterson: Applicative Programming with Effects">original paper</a>, but is generally less
familiar (<code>Monoidal</code>).</p>

<p>The standard definition makes a perfect sense with the standard uses in Haskell,
however I always preferred the alternative definition. Edward uses the alternative
(<code>Monoidal</code>) definition to explain the laws that should hold about applicative 
functors and to explain <em>commutative</em> applicative functors, but I think it
is even more useful.</p>

<p>The <code>Monoidal</code> definition fits nicely with a trick that you can use to 
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx" title="T. Petricek: Beyond the Monad fashion (I.): Writing idioms in LINQ">encode applicative functors in C# using LINQ</a> and I also used it as 
a basis for an F# syntax extension that allows writing code using applicative 
functors in a similar style as using monads (which is discussed in my draft 
paper about <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tp322/papers/notations.html" title="T. Petricek and D. Syme: Syntax Matters: Writing abstract computations in F#">writing abstract computations in F#</a>). And I also think that
<em>commutative</em> applicative functors deserve more attention.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx/">Why type-first development matters</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/type-first-development/tfd.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>Using functional programming language changes the way you write code in a number
of ways. Many of the changes are at a <em>small-scale</em>. For example, you learn how to express
computations in a shorter, more declarative way using higher-order functions.
However, there are also many changes at a <em>large-scale</em>. The most notable one
is that, when designing a program, you start thinking about the (data) types
that represent the data your code works with.</p>

<p>In this article, I describe this approach. Since the acronym TDD is already taken,
I call the approach Type-First Development (TFD), which is probably a better name anyway.
The development is not <em>driven</em> by types. It <em>starts</em> with types, but the rest of the
implementation can still use test-driven development for the implementation.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates the approach using a case study from a real life:
My example is a project that I started working on with a friend who needed a
system to log journeys with a company car (for expense reports). Using the
type-first approach made it easier to understand and discuss the problem.</p>

<p>In many ways, TFD is a very simple approach, so this article just gives a name
to a practice that is quite common among functional and F# programmers (and
we have been <a href="http://functional-programming.net/courses/">teaching it at our F# trainings</a> for the last year)...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/variance-explained.aspx/">The theory behind covariance and contravariance in C# 4</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/icon.png" title="Category theory is sometimes called 'general abstract nonsense', but it can actually be useful!" class="rdecor" />

<p>In C# 4.0, we can annotate generic type parameters with <code>out</code> and <code>in</code> annotations to 
specify whether they should behave <em>covariantly</em> or <em>contravariantly</em>. This is mainly
useful when using already defined standard interfaces. Covariance means that you can use
<code>IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;</code> in place where <code>IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;</code> is expected. Contravariance
allows you to pass <code>IComparable&lt;object&gt;</code> as an argument of a method taking <code>IComparable&lt;string&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So far, so good. If you already learned about covariance and contravariance in C# 4, then 
the above two examples are probably familiar. If you're new to the concepts, then 
the examples should make sense (after a bit of thinking, but I'll say more about them). 
However, there is still a number of questions. Is there some easy way to explain the 
two concepts? Why one option makes sense for some types and the other for different types? 
And why the hell is it called <em>covariance</em> and <em>contravariance</em> anyway?</p>

<p>In this blog post, I'll explain some of the mathematics that you can use to think 
about covariance and contravariance.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-academia.aspx/">F# in Academia: Present at upcoming events!</a></h1>
    
<p>The F# language was born as a combination of the pragmatic and real-world .NET 
platform and functional programming, which had a long tradition in academia. 
Many useful ideas or libraries in F# (like <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and 
<em>first-class events</em>) are inspored by research in functional programming
(namely, the work on <em>monads</em>, <em>continuations</em> and <em>functional reactive programming</em>).</p>

<p>Exchanging the ideas between the research community and the real-world is one
of the areas where F# excels. Indeed, the first applicatiosn of F# inside Microsoft
(in the Machine Learning group at Cambridge) were all about this - combining
research in machine learning with a language that can be easily used in practice.</p>

<p>However, F# and the F# users also made numerous contributions to the programming
language research community. Influential ideas that come from F# include 
<em>active patterns</em> and the F# style of <em>meta-programming</em> for translating F# to 
JavaScript). I think there is a lot more that the academic community can learn
from the F# community, so I'd like to invite you to talk about your ideas 
at two upcoming academic events!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-implement.aspx/">TryJoinads (VII.) - Implementing joinads for async workflows</a></h1>
    
<p>The article <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-prog.aspx">Asynchronous workflows and joinads</a> gives numerous
examples of programming with asynchronous workflows using the <code>match!</code> construct.
Briefly, when matching on multiple asynchronous workflows, they are executed in 
parallel. When pattern matching consists of multiple clauses, the clause that matches
on computations that complete first gets executed. These two behaviours are 
implemented by the <code>Merge</code> and the <code>Choose</code> operation of joinads. Additionally, 
asynchronous workflows require the <code>Alias</code> operation, which makes it possible to 
share the result of a started asynchronous workflow in multiple clauses.</p>

<p>In this article, we look at the definition of the additional <code>AsyncBuilder</code>
operations that enable the <code>match!</code> syntax. We do not look at additional examples
of using the syntax, because these can be <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-prog.aspx">found in a previous article</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-parsing.aspx/">TryJoinads (VI.) - Parsing with joinads</a></h1>
    
<p>In functional programming, parser combinators are a powerful way of writing parsers. 
A parser is a function that, given some input, returns possible parsed values and 
the rest of the input. Parsers can be written using combinators for composition, for
example run two parsers in sequence or perform one parser any number of times.</p>

<p>Parsers can also implement the monad structure. In some cases, this makes the parser
less efficient, but it is an elegant way of composing parsers and we can also benefit
from the syntactic support for monads. In this article, we implement a simple parser
combinators for F# and we look what additional expressive power we can get from the
<em>joinad</em> structure and <code>match!</code> construct. This article is largely based on a
previous article <em>"Fun with Parallel Monad Comprehensions"</em>, which can be found on the
<a href="../pubs.html">publications</a> page.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-options.aspx/">TryJoinads (V.) - Implementing the option joinad</a></h1>
    
<p>This article shows how to implement the <em>joinad</em> structure for one of the 
simplest monads - the <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code> type. This is a slightly oversimplified example. 
The <code>match!</code> construct can be used to write patterns that specify that a monadic
value (in this case <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code>) should contain a certain value, or we can specify
that we do not require a value. When working with options, this means the same thing 
as matching the value against <code>Some</code> and against <code>_</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>However, the example demonstrates the operations that need to be implemented and
their type signatures. Later articles give more interesting examples including
parsers and asynchronous workflows (and you can explore other examples if you look
at the <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Joinads">FSharp.Joiands source code</a> at GitHub).</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-join-calculus.aspx/">TryJoinads (IV.) - Concurrency using join calculus</a></h1>
    
<p>Join calculus provides a declarative way of expressing asynchronous synchronization
patterns. It has been use as a basis for programming languages (JoCaml and COmega), but also
as a basis for libraries (embedded in C# and Scala). Using joinads, it is possible to 
embed join calculus in F# with a nice syntax using the <code>match!</code> construct. Formally,
join calculus does not form a <em>monad</em>, but it can be viewed as a version of <em>joinad</em>
as described in the <a href="../pubs.html">first paper on joinads</a>.</p>

<p>The programming model is based on <em>channels</em> and <em>join patterns</em>. A channel can be viewed
as a thread-safe mailbox into which we can put values without blocking the caller. In some
sense, this is quite similar to <a href="agents.html">F# agents</a>. A join pattern is then a rule
saying that a certain combination of values in channels should trigger a specific reaction
(and remove values from the channels). The ability to match on multiple channels distinguishes
join calculus from F# agents.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-agents.aspx/">TryJoinads (III.): Agent-based programming</a></h1>
    
<p>Another area where the <code>match!</code> syntax can be used is when programming with F# <em>agents</em>,
implemented by the <code>MailboxProcessor</code> type. Formally, agents do not form the monad
structure in a useful way - when programming with agents, we do not compose a new agents,
but instead we write code that (imperatively) receives messages from the agent's mailbox
and handles them.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates an <code>agent { ... }</code> computation builder that can be used for 
implementing the body of an agent. Normally, the body of an agent is an <em>asynchronous
workflow</em>. The code in the body uses <code>let!</code> to perform asynchronous operations, most 
importantly to call <code>inbox.Receive</code> to get the next message from the inbox. When the
agent intends to handle only certain kinds of messages, it can use <code>inbox.Scan</code>. When
using the <code>agent</code> builder, pattern matching on messages can be written using <code>match!</code> and
it is possible to write code that ignores certain types of messages simply by writing an
incomplete pattern matching.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinad-tasks.aspx/">TryJoinads (II.): Task-based parallelism</a></h1>
    
<p>The implementation of joinad operations for the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type is quite similar to the 
implementation of <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code>, because the two types have similar properties. They both
produce at most one value (or an exception) and they both take some time to complete.</p>

<p>Just like for asynchronous workflows, pattern matching on multiple computations using 
<code>match!</code> gives us a parallel composition (with the two tasks running in parallel) and
choice between clauses is non-deterministic, depending on which clause completes first.</p>

<p>Unlike asynchronous workflows, the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type does not require any support for
aliasing. A value of type <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> represents a <em>running</em> computation that can be
accessed from multiple parts of program. In this sense, the type <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code> is more
similar to a function <code>unit -&gt; Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> than to the type <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> itself.</p>

<p>The key difference between tasks and asynchronous workflows is that the latter provides
better support for writing non-blocking computations that involve <em>asynchronous</em> 
long-running operations such as I/O or waiting for a certain event. Tasks are more
suitable for high-performance CPU-intensive computations.</p>

when waiting for a completion of long-running operation such as web service call,

<p>If you have been following my blog, you've probably already heard of <em>joinads</em>. It is
a research extension of F# computation expressions (or monads in Haskell). The extension
makes computation expressions more useful in domains like parallel, concurrent and reactive
programming. However, it can be used for any type of computation including, for example, parsers.
If you're interested in detailed description, you can find it in two academic papers that
I blogged about previously: <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">PADL 2011</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/docase-haskell.aspx">Haskell 2011</a>.</p>

<p>The extension adds a keyword <code>match!</code> - as the syntax suggests, it is akin to pattern
matching using <code>match</code>, but instead of pattern matching on values, you can pattern match
on computations like <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code> (or on other monadic values). Just like other features of
computation expressions, the <code>match!</code> syntax is translated to applications of several
methods defined by the computation builder.</p>

<p>I won't say more about joinads in this post, because you can now easily try joinads yourself...</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/async-sequences/decor.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>In F#, we can represent asynchronous operations that do not block threads and eventually
  return a value of type <code>'T</code> using asynchronous workflows <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code>.
  Asynchronous workflows can be easily constructed using the computation expression syntax
  <code>async { ... }</code> and there are also a few combi&#173;nators that express more advanced
  composition (such as parallel composition or fork-join parallelism).</p>

<p>Sometimes, we need to use asynchronous operations that return more than just one value.
  For example, when downloading data from the internet, we would like to create an 
  <em>asynchronous sequence</em> that returns the data in chunks as they become available.</p>

<p>One way to represent asynchronous operations that produce multiple values is to use 
  the <code>IObservable&lt;'T&gt;</code> type from .NET. This isn't always the best option 
  though. Observables implement <em>push-based</em> model, which means that chunks of data are
  generated as quickly as possible (until all chunks are emitted). What if we wanted to take 
  the chunks one-by-one after the previous chunk is processed?</p>

<p>In this article, I describe <em>asynchronous sequences</em>. An asynchronous sequence is a simple,
  yet very powerful concept based on asynchronous workflows. It follows the same core model: results 
  are generated on demand and asynchronously. Unlike asynchronous workflows, asynchronous sequences
  can be called (on demand) to generate multiple values until the end of the sequence is reached.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">I first discussed asynchronous sequences with Don Syme, Dmitry Lomov and Brian McNamara in an
  email thread a long time ago. Thanks to Don for enthusiasm about the concept and for the 
  first implementation of some of the combinators!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/docase-haskell.aspx/">Extending Monads with Pattern Matching (Haskell 2011)</a></h1>
    
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">paper about <em>joinads</em></a> and the <code>match!</code> extension
  of the F# language. The paper was quite practically oriented and didn't go into much details about 
  the theory behind <em>joinads</em>. Many of the examples from the F# version relied on some
  imperative features of F#. I believe that this is useful for parctical programming, but I 
  also wanted to show that the same idea can work in the <em>purely functional</em> context.</p>

<p>To show that joinads work in the pure setting, I created a Haskell version of the idea.
  The implementation (available below) is quite simple and consists of a pre-processor for 
  Haskell source files and numerous examples. However, more important part of the recent work of 
  joinads is a more detailed theoretical background.</p>

<p>The theory of joinads, together with the language design of Haskell extension that implements
  it is discussed in a paper <em>Extending Monads with Pattern Matching</em>, which was accepted
  for publication at the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2011/index.html">Haskell 
  Symposium 2011</a>. Here is the abstract of the paper:</p>

      <p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
      Sequencing of effectful computations can be neatly captured using monads and elegantly written using 
      <code>do</code> notation. In practice such monads often allow additional ways of composing computations, 
      which have to be written explicitly using combinators.
      </p><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
      We identify joinads, an abstract notion of computation that is stronger than monads and captures
      many such ad-hoc extensions. In particular, joinads are monads with three additional operations: 
      one of type <code>m a -> m b -> m (a, b)</code> captures various forms of <em>parallel composition</em>, 
      one of type <code>m a -> m a -> m a</code> that is inspired by <em>choice</em> and one of type <code>m a -> m (m a)</code> 
      that captures <em>aliasing</em> of computations. Algebraically, the first two operations form a 
      near-semiring with commutative multiplication.
      </p><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
      We introduce <code>docase</code> notation that can be viewed as a monadic version of <code>case</code>. Joinad laws
      make it possible to prove various syntactic equivalences of programs written using <code>docase</code> 
      that are analogous to equivalences about <code>case</code>. Examples of joinads that benefit from the notation
      include speculative parallelism, waiting for a combination of user interface events, but also 
      encoding of validation rules using the intersection of parsers.

This article is a re-publication of an article that I wrote some time ago for 
<a href="http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/">The Monad.Reader</a> magazine, which is an
online magazine about functional programming and Haskell. You can also
read the article in the original PDF format as part of the <a href="http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/issue18.pdf">Issue 18</a>
(together with two other interesting articles). The samples from the article can be found <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.Joinads">on Github</a>.
</p>

<p>Monad comprehensions have an interesting history. They were the first syntactic extension for 
programming with monads. They were implemented in Haskell, but later replaced with plain list
comprehensions and monadic <code>do</code> notation. Now, monad comprehensions are back in Haskell,
more powerful than ever before!</p>

<p>Redesigned monad comprehensions generalize the syntax for working with lists. Quite interestingly, 
they also generalize syntax for zipping, grouping and ordering of lists. This article shows how to 
use some of the new expressive power when working with well-known monads. You'll learn what 
"parallel composition" means for parsers, a poor man's concurrency monad and an evaluation

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/safe-gui-async.aspx/">Safer asynchronous workflows for GUI programming</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/safe-gui-async/screen.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 15px;" />

<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-non-blocking-gui.aspx">previous article</a>,
  I discussed how to use F# asynchronous work&#173;flows for creating reactive user-interfaces.
  One of the main concerns was to avoid blocking the GUI thread (to prevent the user-interface
  from freezing). The workflow shouldn't perform any CPU-intensive compu&#173;tation when running
  on the GUI thread.</p>

<p>The standard F# library provides two ways to run a computation on a background thread from
  an asynchronous workflow. The <code>StartChild</code> operation starts an operation 
  in the thread pool and returns a workflow that can be called using asynchronous (non-blocking)
  <code>let!</code> construct. The <code>SwitchToThreadPool</code> operation can be called
  using <code>do!</code> and resumes the rest of the workflow on a background thread.</p>

<p>When using the <code>SwitchToThreadPool</code> operation, we also need to eventually use
  <code>SwitchToContext</code> to transfer the execution back to the GUI thread (after 
  completing the CPU-intensive calculations). In this article, I describe a variation of 
  F# asynchronous workflows that keeps track of the running thread in the type of the 
  computation. As a result, calling a workflow that should be executed on a GUI thread 
  from a background thread is a compile-time error as opposed to failing at runtime.</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/async-non-blocking-calls/screen.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 0px 15px;" />

<p>F# asynchronous workflows are best known as a way to write efficient I/O operations
  or as an underlying mechanism of F# agent-based programming (using the <code>MailboxProcessor</code>
  type). However, they are also very useful for user-interface programming. I think this is 
  a very interesting and important area, so I already wrote and talked about this topic - 
  it is covered in <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/">Chapter 16 of my book</a> (there
  is a <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx">free excerpt</a>)
  and I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx">talked about it</a> at F#unctional Londoners
  meeting.</p>

<p>Many applications combine user-interface programming (such as waiting for an event asynchronously)
  with some CPU-intensive tasks. This article looks at an example of such application and I'll explain 
  how to avoid blocking the user-interface when doing the CPU-intensive task. 
  The article starts with an example that is wrong and blocks the user-interface when doing data processing.
  Then I'll show you two options for fixing the problem. The three most important
  functions from the standard F# library that I'll discuss are <code>Async.StartChild</code> and 
  <code>Async.SwitchTo&#173;ThreadPool</code> with <code>Async.SwitchToContext</code>.</p>

<p>This is the first article of a mini-series. In the next article, I'll demonstrate a simple
  wrapper for F# <code>async</code> that makes it more difficult to write <em>wrong</em> 
  programs. The wrapper keeps the desired thread (GUI or background) in the type of the 
  computations and code that would block the user interface will not type-check. But first,
  let's look at the example...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/speculative-par-monad.aspx/">Explicit speculative parallelism for Haskell's Par monad</a></h1>
    
<p>Haskell provides quite a few ways for writing parallel programs, but none of them is fully automatic.
  The programmer has to use some annotations or library to run computations in parallel <em>explicitly</em>. 
  The most recent paper (and library) for writing parallel programs follows the latter approach. You can find more
  information about the library in a paper by Simon Marlow et al. <a type="external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/parallel/monad-par.pdf">A
  monad for deterministic parallelism</a> and it is also available on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-par" type="external">Hackage</a>.
  However, I'll explain all the important bits that I'll use in this article.</p>

<p>The library provides an explicit way for writing parallel programs using a <code>Par</code> monad. The library contains 
  constructs for spawning computations and sharing state using blocking variables. However, the whole programming model
  is fully deterministic. I believe that it is sometimes useful to lift the determinacy requirement.
  Some programs are deterministic, but the fact cannot be (easily) automatically verified. For example, say you have two functions
  <code>fib1</code> and <code>fib2</code>. They both give the same result, but each of them is more efficient
  than the other one on certain inputs. To calculate a Fibonacci number, the program could <em>speculatively</em> 
  try to evaluate both functions in parallel and return the result of the one that finishes first.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this cannot be safely implemented using a fully deterministic library. In this article, I'll show some
  examples where speculative parallelism can be useful and I'll talk about an extension to the <code>Par</code> monad
  that I implemented (available on <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.ParMonad">GitHub</a>). The extension allows 
  programmers to write <em>speculative computations</em>, provided that they manually verify that their code is 
  deterministic. </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-variations-joinads.aspx/">Variations in F#: Research compiler with Joinads and more!</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article, I'll write about an experimental extension for F# that I call 
  <em>joinads</em>. If you're following my blog, you may have seen an 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">academic paper</a> that
  I wrote about it some time ago. Anyway, the motivation for the extension
  is that there are many useful programming models for reactive, concurrent and parallel programming 
  that would deserve some syntactic support in the programming language.</p>

<p>For example, when programming with <em>futures</em> (the <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> type), 
  you may want to implement logical "or" operator for tasks that returns <code>true</code>
  immediately when the first task completes returning <code>true</code>. When programming with 
  <em>events</em> (the <code>IObservable&lt;T&gt;</code> type),
  we'd like to wait for the event that happens first. Finally, when programming using <em>agents</em>,
  we sometimes need to wait only for certain types of messages. All of these problems can
  be solved, but require the use of (sometimes fairly complicated) functions. Joinads make
  it possible to solve them directly using the <code>match!</code> syntax. For example, here
  is the "or" operator for tasks:</p>

<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="l">1: </span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs1', 1)" class="i">future</span> {
<span class="l">2: </span>  <span class="k">match!</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs2', 2)" class="i">after</span> <span class="n">100</span> <span class="k">true</span>, <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs2', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs2', 3)" class="i">after</span> <span class="n">1000</span> <span class="k">false</span> <span class="k">with</span>
<span class="l">3: </span>  | <span class="o">!</span><span class="k">true</span>, _ <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">true</span>
<span class="l">4: </span>  | _, <span class="o">!</span><span class="k">true</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">true</span>
<span class="l">5: </span>  | <span class="o">!</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs3', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs3', 4)" class="i">a</span>, <span class="o">!</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs4', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs4', 5)" class="i">b</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs3', 6)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs3', 6)" class="i">a</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'jofs4', 7)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'jofs4', 7)" class="i">b</span> }</pre>

<p>I'll write more about this example (and the implementation) in a later article. This article
  focuses on the compiler extension itself. I created a first implementation of the idea above during
  my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/internship-match-bang.aspx">internship with Don Syme at MSR Cambridge</a>,
  but then changed it quite a bit when writing the academic paper mentioned above. However, I never released
  the source code.
</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx">open-source release of F#</a> it is now 
  quite easy to modify the F# compiler and make the modifications available, so I decided I should 
  finally release my F# extensions. I also recently <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx">blogged</a>
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/formlets-in-linq.aspx">about</a> encoding <em>idioms</em> (also called
  <em>applicative functors</em>) in C#. I was wondering how to do that in F# and so I also created a simple
  extension computations based on this abstraction. The support for <em>idioms</em> is just an experiment, but it could 
  be useful, for example, for programming with formlets. You'll find more about it at the end of the 
  article.

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Extensions">source code on my GitHub</a> 
  (there is also a link compiled binaries at the end of the article).
  The source code is cloned from an F# Mono repository, which means that it should build on Linux and 
  MacOS too. </p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/formlets-in-linq.aspx/">Beyond the Monad fashion (II.): Creating web forms with LINQ</a></h1>
    
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/formlets-in-linq/screen.png" style="margin:15px;float:right;" />
<p>The LINQ query syntax can be used for various things. Aside from writing queries, you can 
  also use it to encode any <em>monads</em>. This has become a fashionable topic, so you can learn
  more about it at many .NET conferences (for example <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=434">GOTO 2011</a>).
  There are also many blog posts on this topic and I explained it in details in Chapter 12 of <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">my book</a>, which
  is available as a <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/SampleChapter12.pdf">free sample chapter</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>However, you can also use LINQ syntax for writing different types of computations. In a 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx">previous blog post</a>, I introduced <em>idioms</em>
  (also called <em>applicative functors</em>) and I demonstrated how to use the <code>join</code> syntax in LINQ
  to write computations based on idioms. We looked at a slightly boring, but simple example - zipping of lists - and
  we also implemented matrix transposition.</p>
 
<p>In this blog post, we look at a more exciting example. I explain <em>formlets</em>, which is an <em>idiom</em>
  for building web forms. Formlets give us an elegant functional way to create reusable components that encapsulate
  both visual aspect (HTML) and behavior (processing of requests). You can think of them as functional ASP.NET controls.
  Formlets come from the <a href="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/formlets/">Links project</a> and they are now used in commercial products like
  <a href="http://www.websharper.com/tutorials/GettingStartedWithFormlets.aspx">WebSharper</a>. In this article, you'll see that we can (mis)use LINQ to get a nicer syntax
  for writing code using formlets. My C# implementation of formlets is based on a nice <a href="http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/2011/01/simple-implementation-of-formlets-in-f.html">F# formlets by Mauricio
  Scheffer</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx/">Beyond the Monad fashion (I.): Writing idioms in LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>Thanks to LINQ and Erik Meier, monads have become a fashionable topic in the C# developer community.
  Indeed, no serious developer conference on .NET can get away without having a talk on monads. The attractive
  thing about LINQ and monads is that the <code>SelectMany</code> operator roughly corresponds to the <em>bind</em>
  function that defines a monad. In practice, LINQ is used for working with collections of data (<code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>),
  but you can also define <em>bind</em> (i.e. <code>SelectMany</code>) for some other data types and use the LINQ syntax
  for working with other types. You won't be really using the full LINQ syntax. You'll probably use just nested
  <code>from</code> clauses (for <em>binding</em>) and <code>select</code> at the end to return the result.</p>

<p>However, monads are not the only notion of computation that we can work with. More interestingly, they are also 
  not the only notion of computation that you can encode using LINQ! In this article, I'll briefly introduce 
  <em>idioms</em> (also called <em>applicative functors</em>), which is another useful abstract type of computations.
  Idioms can be used for a few things that cannot be done using monads.</p>

<p>A provocative summary of this article is: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">"Everyone who tells you that LINQ is a monad is wrong!"</span></p>

<p>The truth is
that LINQ syntax can be used for encoding <em>queries</em> (obviously), <em>monads</em> (as you were told), but also for <em>idioms</em> as you'll learn today (and quite possibly for other types of computations). In this article, we look at a basic example, but I'll describe a more complex real-world scenario in the next blog post.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx/">Reactive, parallel and concurrent programming in F# (PADL 2011)</a></h1>
    
<p>Don Syme blogged about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/10/21/the-f-asynchronous-programming-model-padl-2010-pre-publication-draft.aspx" type="extenal">
  a paper on the F# Asynchrounous Programming Model</a> that I helped to write. Without any doubt,
  the asynchronous programming features of F# are one of the reason for its success and also 
  influence other teams in Microsoft. However, I'm very glad that there is now also an academic
  paper that makes this idea accessible to the academic community. I believe that the ideas could
  evolve in interesting ways when used in other programming languages and also, it is now easier to 
  create research projects that build on top of the F# model.</p>

<p>Don already mentioned that we have another paper accepted at PADL. The paper describes work 
  that started during my internship at Microsoft Research in 2009. It presents a simple 
  language extension for <em>computation expressions</em> that makes them even more useful 
  in some reactive, concurrent and parallel programming models. Note that this is only a 
  research project and there are currently no plans to support the extension in the F# language
  (although, if there will, eventually, be an open-source F# release, then you'll hear about the 
  extension again...)</p>

<p>Here is the abstract of the paper (accepted at <a href="http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/PADL-2011/">PADL 2011</a>) and a PDF download link:</p>

<h3 style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;">Joinads: A retargetable control-flow construct for reactive, parallel and concurrent programming</h3>

<p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
  Modern challenges led to a design of a wide range of programming models for reactive, parallel 
  and concurrent programming, but these are often difficult to encode in general purpose languages. 
  We present an abstract type of computations called joinads together with a syntactic language 
  extension that aims to make it easier to use joinads in modern functional languages. </p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
  Our extension generalizes pattern matching to work on abstract computations. It keeps a familiar 
  syntax and semantics of pattern matching making it easy to reason about code, even in a 
  non-standard programming model. We demonstrate our extension using three important programming 
  models – a reactive model based on events; a concurrent model based on join calculus and a 
  parallel model using futures. All three models are implemented as libraries that benefit from 
  our syntactic extension. This makes them easier to use and also opens space for exploring new 
  useful programming models.</p>

<p>The paper can still be revised before the final publication, so any comments and suggestions
  for improvement are largely welcome. You can contact me either via comments (below) or using 
  email at <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>. I would be also quite interested
  to hear from anybody who would like to implement similar feature in other programming languages

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx/">The Duality of Object and Event references</a></h1>
    
<p>Mathematical duality [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx
#duallinks">2</a>] 
  is a very useful and elegant concept that gives us a nice way of speaking
  about objects or structures that behave in some way exactly conversely. There
  is no clear definition of what <em>duality</em> is. However, the idea is that when we
  have two structures that behave conversely and we know that something is true
  about the first one, then we get the opposite statement about the other structure
  "for free" (if you know how to translate from one structure to the other).</p>

<p>In this article, I'll talk about an interesting example of duality that (to my best
  knowledge) wasn't described by anyone before. The two dual structures are 
  <strong>references between objects</strong> in a normal program and <strong>references
  between events</strong> in a reactive application. The statement that is going to 
  become obvious thanks to the duality principle is describing which of the objects (or
  events) are garbage and can be safely collected by garbage collector.</p>

<p>This topic is in much more details 
  discussed in a paper [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx
#duallinks">4</a>] I wrote with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/dsyme/">Don Syme</a> 
  and that I presented at the ISMM Workshop (see also <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/pldi-2010-trip.aspx">my
  trip report from PLDI</a>). In this article, I'll try to give an accessible
  description of the most interesting idea from the paper...</p>
