    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2023/vague-spaces/">Where programs live? Vague spaces and software systems</a></h1>
    <p>Architecture and urban planning have been a useful source of ideas for thinking about programming.
I have written <a href="https://tomasp.net/blog/tag/design/">various blog posts</a> and a paper
<a href="https://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/">Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning</a>
that argue why and explore some of those ideas. Like urban planning and architecture, the design of
any interesting software system deals with complex problems that can rarely be analysed in full and
with structures that will continue to evolve in unexpected ways after they are created.</p>
<p>My most recent reading on cities was a book <a href="https://www.academia.cz/mesto-naruby-2-dotisk--haluzik-radan--academia--2021">The City Inside Out</a>
(Czech only, unfortunately) that explore places referred to as <a href="https://www.atributosurbanos.es/en/terms/terrain-vague/">terrain vague</a>.
This term refers to unused and abandoned spaces that have lost their purpose or
do not have a clear use, but are used in various ways nevertheless. For various historical
reasons, there seem to be quite a few of such places in Prague (Figure 1) and, more generally,
Central European cities, which is the focus of the book.</p>
<p>The book is an interesting inspiration for thinking about programming in many ways.
It uses an inter-disciplinary approach ranging from history and philosophy to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoethnobotany">archaeobotany</a>, which is much needed for thinking
about programming too. (Not archeobotany, but inter-disciplinary thinking certainly!)
More specifically, it makes you think about the concept of a <em>space</em> in
which cities and programs exist, how the spaces inhabited by the two differ, what would it look
like if they were different and what structures get created in those spaces as a result of
social and technical forces.</p>

<p style="max-width:260px"><b>Figure 1.</b> The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander</p>
</div>
<p>Many programmers know the name of the architect Christopher Alexander for his work on
<em>design patterns</em> that has been adapted into the world of programming. A lot of people
know of the, sometimes ridiculed, patterns like strategy (functions!) or visitor (pattern
matching!) and some have read the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Cd7sBv" title="Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software - Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides">Gang of Four design patterns book</a> that introduced them.
A few people know of the <a href="https://dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf" title="Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community - Richard P. Gabriel">Patterns of Software</a> book by Richard P. Gabriel, which is a much more
profound reflection on software inspired by the work of Christopher Alexander. And almost
nobody has actually read Christopher Alexander's books. (Thanks in advance for reminding me
on <a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">Twitter</a> that I am mistaken...)</p>
<p>I read Alexander's <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2" title="Notes on the Synthesis of Form - Christopher Alexander">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a> a couple of years ago, and used
it as one of the sources for ideas in my recent Onward! essay on <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/" title="Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning - Tomas Petricek">architecture, design and urban
planning</a>, but I did not know his other work. Only recently, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/29/christopher-alexander-obituary">Christopher Alexander
died</a>,
I finally ordered two books that are most directly about design patterns,
<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">The Timeless Way of Building</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3wecpGG" title="A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction - Christopher Alexander">A Pattern Language</a>.</p>
<p>This post is a somewhat unorganized collection of thoughts triggered by reading of The Timeless
Way of Building, including my understanding of Alexander's work, some critical thoughts
and on the applications of his ideas to software.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2022/no-code-substrates/">No-code, no thought? Substrates for simple programming for all</a></h1>
    <div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center">

<p style="max-width:350px"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Virtually eliminates your coding load. FLOW-MATIC promotional
brochure (1957)</p>
</div>
<p>No-code is a hot new topic for programming startups. The idea is to develop a system
that allows end-users to do the programming they need without the difficult task of writing
code. There are no-code systems for building mobile apps, analysing data and many more.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not a surprise that "eliminating programming load" is not as new idea as some
people may think and there is an excellent blog series on <a href="https://instadeq.com/blog/categories/history/" title="No-code history - Instadeq Blog - No-code Data Analysis &amp; Interactive Visualizations">no-code history by Instadeq</a>,
going back to 1959.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the 1957 <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102646140" title="Introducing a New Language for Automatic Programming Univac Flow-Matic">promotional brochure about FLOW-MATIC</a>,
a predecessor to COBOL created by Grace Hopper, uses almost the same language that you will
find in startup pitch decks today (Figure 1). Of course, in 1957, coding referred to the
tedious process of transcribing the desired program to low-level assembler or (more often)
directly to machine code and "virtually eliminating your coding load" meant having a symbolic
high-level programming language so easy that a reasonably skilled mathematician would be able
to use it.</p>
<p>So, is there really anything new about no-code systems? Is it really possible to "eliminate
your programming load"? And what would it really take to make some real progress in that direction?</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/popup-from-hell/">Pop-up from Hell: On the growing opacity of web programs</a></h1>
    <p>I started to learn how to program in high school at the end of the 1990s using a mix of BASIC, Turbo
Pascal and HTML with JavaScript. The seed for this blog post comes from my experience with learning
how to program in JavaScript, without having much guidance or organized resources. This article continues
a theme that I started in my <a href="http://tomasp.net/commodore64">interactive Commodore 64 article</a>,
which is to look at past programming systems and see what interesting past ideas have been lost
in contemporary systems. Unlike with Commodore 64, which I first used in 2018 in the
Seattle Living Computers museum, my perspective on the Early Web may be biased by personal
experience. I will do my best to not make this post sound like a grumbling of an old nerd!
(I thought this only comes later, but I may have been wrong...)</p>
<div class="rdecor"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/popup-from-hell/close-me.gif" style="max-width:400px" /></div>
<p>The 1990s, the web had a fair amount of quirky web pages, often created just for fun. The GeoCities
hosting service, which has <a href="http://www.oocities.org">partly been archived</a> is a witness of this
and there are even academic books, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/2YiEUVe">Dot-Com Design</a> documenting
this history.</p>
<p>Some of the quirky things that you could do with JavaScript included creating roll-over effects
(making an image change when mouse pointer is over it), creating an animation that follows the
cursor as it moves and, of course, annoying the users with all sorts of pop-up windows for both
entertaining and advertising purposes. Annoying pop-ups will be the starting point for my blog
post, but I'll be using those to make a more general and interesting point about how programs
evolve to become more opaque.</p>
<p><em>This blog post is based on a talk <a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/Talks/2021/popup-from-hell/">Popup from hell: Reflections on the most annoying 1990s
program</a> that I did recently at an
(in person!) meeting of the <a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/">PROGRAMme project</a>. Thanks to
everyone who attended for lively discussion and useful feedback!</em></p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/software-designers/">Software designers, not engineers: An interview from alternative universe</a></h1>
    <p>While the physicists investigate the nature of the mysterious portal that has recently appeared in
North London, several human beings recently came through the portal, which appears to be a
gate into an alternative universe. As we understood from the last two people coming through the
portal, it seems to be a linked with a universe that is in many ways like ours, reached about the
same level of social and technological development, but differs in numerous curious details.
The paths through which people in this alternative universe reached similar results as our world
are often subtly different.</p>
<div class="rdecor"><a href="https://amzn.to/3x0Ww5a"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/software-designers/ways.png" style="max-width:260px" /></a></div>
<p>The most recent visitor from the alternative universe is Ms Zaha Atkinson, who would most likely
be titled <em>software engineer</em> in our world, although the title she uses in her home world is
<em>software designer</em>. She is a well-known software designer and has been also titled using the
strange-sounding title <em>softwarenova</em>, a label that we will soon say more about. As with other
technological and societal developments, the alternative universe seems to have arrived at very
similar results as our worlds. Software is eating the (alternative) world, but it is built in very
different ways. The interview with Ms Zaha Atkinson, presented below, reveals how very different
the world of software is when we think of programmers as software <em>designers</em> rather than as
software <em>engineers</em>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/data-exploration-calculus/">Data exploration calculus: Capturing the essence of exploratory data scripting</a></h1>
    <p>Most real-world programming languages are too complex to be studied using formal methods.
For this reason, academics often work with simple theoretical languages instead. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">λ-calculus</a>
is a simple formal language that is often used for talking about functional languages, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">π-calculus</a>
is a model of concurrent programming and there is an entire book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8598-9">A Theory of Objects</a>
modelling various object-oriented systems.</p>
<div class="rdecor"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/data-exploration-calculus/ft.gif" style="width:360px"/><br/><p style="width:360px;line-height:20px;margin-top:10px;text-align:center;"><small>Animation from Financial Times article "Why the world's recycling system stopped working".</small></p></div>
<p>Those calculi try to capture the most interesting aspect of the programming language. This is
function application in functional programming, sending of messages in concurrent programming
and object construction with inheritance in object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been working on programming tools for data exploration.
In particular, I'm interested in the kind of programming that journalists need to do when
they work with data. A good example is the coding done for the
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8">Why the world's recycling system stopped working</a>
article by Financial Times, which is <a href="https://github.com/ft-interactive/recycling-is-broken-notebooks">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Although data journalists and other data scientists use regular programming languages like
Python, the kind of code they write is very different from the kind of code you need to write
when building a library or a web application in Python.</p>
<p>In a paper <a href="https://programming-journal.org/2020/4/8/">Foundations of a live data exploration environment</a>
that was published in February 2020 in the open access <a href="https://programming-journal.org/">Programming Journal</a>,
I wanted to talk about some interesting work that I've been doing on live previews in
<a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma</a>. For this, I needed a small model of my programming language.</p>
<p>In the end the most interesting aspect of the paper is the definition of the
<em>data exploration calculus</em>, a small programming language that captures the kind of code
that data scientists write to explore data. This looks quite different from,
say, a λ-calculus and π-calculus. It should be interesting not only if you're planning to do
theoretical programming language research about data scripting, but also because
it captures some of the atypical properties of the programs that data scientists write...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/">On architecture, urban planning and software construction</a></h1>
    <p>Despite having the term <em>science</em> in its name, it is not always clear what kind of
discipline <em>computer science</em> actually is. Research on programming is sometimes like
science, sometimes like mathematics, sometimes like engineering, sometimes like design
and sometimes like art. It also has a long tradition of importing ideas from a wide range
of other disciplines.</p>
<p>In this article, I will look at ideas from architecture and urban planning. Architecture
has already been an inspiration for <em>design patterns</em>, although some would say that we did
quite poor job and imported a trivialized (and not very useful) version of the idea. However,
there are many other interesting ideas in architecture and urban planning worth exploring.</p>
<div class="rdecor-sm"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/patterns.jpg" /></div>
<p>To explain why learning from architecture and urban planning is a good idea, I will first
discuss similarities between problems solved by architects or urban planners and programmers.
I will then look at a number of concrete ideas that we can learn, mostly taking inspiration
from four books that I've read recently. There are two general areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, writing about architecture and urban planning often uses interesting methodologies
that research on programming could adopt to gain new insights into systems, programming
and its problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, there are a number of more concrete ideas in architecture and urban planning that
might directly apply to software. For example, can programmers learn how to deal with complexity
of software by looking at how urban planners deal with the complexity of cities? Or, can we learn
about software maintenance by looking at how buildings evolve in time?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The nature of problems that programmers face are often more similar to the problems that
architects and urban planners have to deal with than, say, the problems that scientists, engineers
or mathematicians need to solve. We might not want to go all the way and completely rebuild
how we do programming to mirror architecture and urban planning, but treating the ideas from those
disciplines as equal to those from science or engineering will make programming richer and more
productive discipline.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2019/first-language/">What to teach as the first programming language and why</a></h1>
    <p>The number of Google search results for the phrase
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=" title="choosing+the+first+programming+language">"choosing the first programming language"</a>
at the time of writing is 15,800. This illustrates just how debated the issue of choosing the first
programming language is. In this blog post, I will not actually try to answer the question posed
in the title of the post. I will not discuss what language we should teach as the first one.
Instead, I will look at a more interesting question.</p>
<p>I will investigate the arguments that are used in favour of or against particular programming
languages in computer science curriculum. I am more interested in the kind of argumentation that
is employed to support a particular choice than in the specific languages involved. This approach is
valuable for two reasons. First, by looking at the argumentation used, we can learn what educators
consider important about computer science. Second, understanding the motivations behind different
arguments allows us to make our own debates about the choice of a programming language more informed.</p>
<p>The scope of this blog post is limited to the choice of the first programming language taught in an
undergraduate computer science programmes at universities. This means that I will not discuss other
important contexts such as choices at a primary or a secondary education level, choices for
independent learners and choices in other university degrees that might involve programming.</p>
<p>Note that this blog post is adapted from an essay that I wrote as part of a
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/teaching/qualifications/pgche/">Postgrduate Certificate for Higher Education programme</a>
at University of Kent, so it assumes less knowledge about programming than a typical reader of
my blog has. This makes it accessible to a broader audience thinking about education
though!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2019/software-engineering/">What should a Software Engineering course look like?</a></h1>
    <p>When I joined the <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/">School of Computing</a> at the <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of
Kent</a>, I was asked what subjects I wanted to teach. One of the topics
I chose was <em>Software Engineering</em>. I spent quite a lot of time reading about the history of
software engineering when working on my paper <a href="/academic/papers/failures/index.html">on programming
errors</a> and I go to a fair number of <a href="http://github.com/tpetricek/Talks">professional
programming conferences</a>, so I thought I can come up
with a good way of teaching it! Yet, I was not quite sure how to go about it or even what
<em>software engineering</em> actually means.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I share my thought process on deciding what to cover in my Software
Engineering module and also a rough list of topics. The introduction explaining <em>why</em> I chose
these and <em>how</em> I structure them is perhaps more important than the list itself, but it
is fairly long, so if you just want to see a list you can
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2019/software-engineering/#fund">skip ahead to Section 2</a> (but please read the
introduction if you want to comment on the list!) I also add a brief reflection on why I think
this is a good approach, referencing a couple of ideas from philosophy of science in <a href="#phil">Section 3</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/programming-interaction/">Programming as interaction: A new perspective for programming language research</a></h1>
    <p>In May, I joined the <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/">School of Computing</a> at the <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of
Kent</a> as a Lecturer (equivalent of Assistant Professor in some other countries).
When applying for the job, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to best explain the kind of
research that I would like to do. This blog post is a brief summary of my ideas. I'm interested
in way too many things, including <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/philosophy/">philosophy and design</a> and
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/data-journalism/">data journalism</a>, but this post will be mainly about
programming language research. After all, I'm a member of the <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/research/groups/plas/">Programming Languages
and Systems group</a>!</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/programming-interaction/kent.png" class="rdecor-sm" style="max-width:250px"/>
<p>Unlike some of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thinking-unthinkable/">other posts about programming languages</a>,
I won't try to convince you that we should be studying programming languages completely differently this
time. Instead, I want to describe <em>one simple trick that will make current programming language
research much more interesting</em>!</p>
<p>A lot of programming language papers today talk about programs and program properties. In
statically typed programming languages, we can check that a program <span class="math">\(e\)</span> has certain type <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>,
which means that, when the program is run, it will only produce values of the type.
This is very nice, but it misses a fundamental thing about programming. How was this program
<span class="math">\(e\)</span> actually constructed?</p>
<p>When programming, you spend most of your time working with programs that are <em>unfinished</em>. This
means that they do not do what they are supposed to be (eventually) doing and, very often, they
are not well-typed or even syntactically invalid. However, that does not mean that we can afford
to ignore them. In many cases, programmers can even run those programs (using REPL or using a
notebook environment). In other words, programming language research should not study <em>programs</em>,
but should instead study <em>programming</em>!</p>

I'm also writing this because I'll soon be looking for collaborators and PhD students,
so if the ideas in this blog post sound interesting to you or if you've been working on
something related, please let me know! You can get in touch at <a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">@tomaspetricek</a>
or email <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have funding for PhD students from September 2019 and I'm also working on getting money
for a post-doc position. All of these are open ended, so if the blog post made you curious
(and you wouldn't mind living in Canterbury or London), definitely reach out!</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/alien-lambda-calculus/">Would aliens understand lambda calculus?</a></h1>
    <p>Unless you are a sci-fi author or some secret government agency, the question whether aliens
would understand lambda calculus is probably not your main practical concern. However, the question
is intriguing because it nicely vividly formulates a fundamental question about our formal mathematical
knowledge. Are mathematical theories and results about them <em>invented</em>, i.e. constructed by
humans, or <em>discovered</em>, i.e. are they eternal truths that exist regardless of whether there are
humans to know them?</p>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/alien-lambda-calculus/human.jpg" class="rdecor"
    style="width:40%;max-width:400px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" />
<p>The question makes for a fantastic late night pub debate, but how can we go about answering it using
a more serious methodology? Is there a paper one can read to better understand the problem?
Occasionally, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R&amp;v=IOiZatlZtGU">talk</a>
or an <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-aliens-have-LISP-or-Scheme">online comment</a>
by a computer scientist comments on this question, but way too often, people miss the fact that
the nature of mathematical entities is one of the fundamental questions of <em>philosophy of
mathematics</em>. Alas, all those discussions are carefully hidden in the humanities department!</p>
<p>I believe that knowing a bit about philosophy of mathematics is important if we want to have a
meaningful debate about philosophical questions of mathematics (sic!) and so I did a talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoWH2jNlvQQ">on this very subject at CodeMesh 2017</a>.
This article is slightly refined and hopefully
more polished version of the talk for those who, like me, prefer reading over watching.
Keep in mind that the question about the nature of mathematical entities is one of the fundamental
questions of an <em>entire academic discipline</em>. As such, this article cannot possibly cover all the
relevant discussions. Compared to some other writings in this space, this article is, at least,
based on a couple of philosophical books that, I believe, have useful things to say on the subject!</p>

<p>The word "design" is often used when talking about programming languages. In fact, it even made
it into the name of one of the most prestigious academic programming conferences, <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/PLDI/">Programming
Language Design and Implementation (PLDI)</a>. Yet, it is
almost impossible to come across a paper about programming languages that uses design methods to
study its subject. We intuitively feel that "design" is an important aspect of programming
languages, but we never found a way to talk about it and instead treat programming languages as
mathematical puzzles or as engineering problems.</p>
<p>This is a shame. Applying design thinking, in the sense used in applied arts, can let us talk
about, explore and answer important questions about programming languages that are ignored when
we limit ourselves to mathematical or engineering methods. I think the programming language
community is, perhaps unconsciously, aware of this - one of the reviews of <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/fsharp-data/">my recent PLDI
paper</a> said <em>"this is a nice, novel design paper,
and the community often wants more design papers in our conferences"</em>. The problem is that we
we do not know how to write and evaluate work that follows design methodology.</p>
<p>To better understand how design works, I recently read <a href="http://amzn.to/2gVxn8W">The Philosophy of Design</a>
by Glenn Parsons. The book perhaps did not answer many of my questions about design, but it did give
me a number of ideas about what design is, what questions it can explore and how those could be
relevant for the study of programming languages...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/papers-we-scrutinize/">Papers we Scrutinize: How to critically read papers</a></h1>
    <p>As someone who enjoys being at the intersection of the academic world and the world of
industry, I'm very happy to see any attempts at bridging this harmful gap. For this reason,
it is great to see that <a href="http://michaelrbernste.in/2014/10/21/should-i-read-papers.html">more people are interested in reading academic
papers</a> and that initiatives
like <a href="http://paperswelove.org/">Papers We Love</a> are there to help.</p>
<a href="http://paperswelove.org/"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/papers-we-scrutinize/pwl.png" class="rdecor" style="width:300px;"/></a>
<p>There is one caveat with academic papers though. It is very easy to see academic papers
as containing eternal and unquestionable truths, rather than as something that the reader
should actively interact with. I <a href="https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek/status/814600193643577344">recently remarked</a>
about this saying that "reading papers" is too passive. I also mentioned one way of doing more
than just "reading", which is to write "critical reviews" – something that we recently tried
to do at the <a href="http://2017.programmingconference.org/track/refuses-2017">Salon des Refusés</a> workshop.
In this post, I would like to expand my remark.</p>
<p>First of all, it is very easy to miss the context in which papers are written. The life of an academic
paper is not complete after it is published. Instead, it continues living its own life – people refer to it
in various contexts, give different meanings to entities that appear in the paper and may "love"
different parts of the paper than the author. This also means that there are different ways of
reading papers. You can try to reconstruct the original historical context, read it according to
the current main-stream interpretation or see it as an inspiration for your own ideas.</p>
<p>I suspect that many people, both in academia and outside, read papers without worrying about
<em>how</em> they are reading them. You can certainly "do science" or "read papers" without reflecting
on the process. That said, I think the philosophical reflection is important if we do not want to
get stuck in local maxima.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/programming-mythology/">The mythology of programming language ideas</a></h1>
    <p>If you read a about the history of science, you will no doubt be astonished by some of the
amazing theories that people used to believe. I recently finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2mPjXtW">The Invention of Science
by David Wootton</a>, which documents many of them (and is well worth reading,
not just because of this!) For example, did you know that if you put garlic on a magnet, the magnet
will stop working? Fortunately, you can recover the magnet by smearing goats blood on it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_della_Porta">Giambattista
della Porta</a> tested this and concluded that it
was false, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ross_(writer)">Alexander Ross</a> argued that
our garlic is perhaps not so vigorous as those of ancient Greeks.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/programming-mythology/heliocentric.jpg">
  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/programming-mythology/heliocentric.jpg" class="rdecor"
    style="width:60%;max-width:400px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:20px" /></a></div>
<p>You can just laugh at these stories, but they can serve as interesting lessons for any scientist.
The lesson, however, is not the obvious one. Academics will <a href="http://danghica.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/what-else-are-we-getting-wrong.html">sometimes read those
stories</a> and use them
to argue against something they do not consider scientific - arguing that it is like believing
that garlic break magnets.</p>
<p>This is not how the analogy works. What is amazing about the old stories is that the conclusions
that now seem funny often had very solid reasoning behind them. If you believed in the basic
assumption of the time, then you could reach the same conclusions by following fairly sound
reasoning principles. In other words, the amazing theories were scientific and entirely reasonable.
The lesson is that what seems a completely reasonable idea now, may turn out to be wrong and quite
hilarious in retrospect.</p>
<p>In this article, I will look at a couple of amazing theories that people believed in the past
and I will explain why they were reasonable given the way of thinking of the time.
Along the way, I will explore some of the ways of thinking that we use today about
programming and computer science and why they might appear silly in the future.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-in-monodevelop.aspx/">F# in MonoDevelop and cross-platform web sites &amp; screencasts</a></h1>
    
<p>About a week ago, I attended the F# in Education workshop in Boston. It was a great event
  with many interesting people around. I believe that the workshop was very exciting for everyone who is
  interested in F#, but uses Mac or Linux. The F# team recently made some effort to improve the
  F# support on Mono (meaning mainly Mac and Linux). The recent <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/10/november-2010-f-2-0-free-tools-update.aspx" type="external">November 2010 CTP update</a>
  contains several bugfixes that make it possible to use F# on Mono 2.8. Another great thing 
  that happened at the workshop is the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx" type="external">open source release of F#</a>
  (see also <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Nov-11.html" type="external">blog post</a> by Miguel with a post-check-in photo).
  At the workshop, I also announced my contribution to the cross-platform F# story, a project that 
  I've been working on recently - <strong>the F# language binding
  for MonoDevelop.</strong>
  </p>

<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center;">
  <a target="_blank" href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-in-monodevelop/screen.png"><img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-in-monodevelop/screen-sm.png" style="border:0px;margin-bottom:5px" /></a><br />
  <a target="_blank" href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-in-monodevelop/screen.png"><small>Click here for a larger screenshot</small></a>
</div>
<p>I promised to make it available as soon as possible after the workshop. As usually, things take
  longer, than one would like, but I'm finally ready to announce the initial (beta) version of the 
  plugin. The screenshot on the right shows some of the features of the F# language binding. As you
  can see, there is an F# Interactive tool window, syntax highlighting as well as IntelliSense 
  auto-completion.</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying it out, here are links to the repository (you can use
  it to install the language binding from the MonoDevelop Add-ins manager) and source
  code. The F# plugin needs to be able to locate F# installation and it also requires 
  more F# assemblies to be installed in the GAC, so you may as well want to read the instructions
  before trying it :-).</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><a href="http://functional-variations.net/monodevelop/" type="external">Project homepage</a> at the Functional Variations 
    web site has more information about the project as well as detailed installation instructions.</li>
  <li>I also created a web page that contains information about <a href="http://functional-variations.net/crossplatform/" type="external">installing
    F# on Mac and Linux</a> which explains how to install F#, such that the MonoDevelop plugin can 
    find it.</li>
  <li>The source code is available in the <a href="http://fsxplat.codeplex.com/" type="external">F# cross-platform packages and samples</a> project at CodePlex
    (under the Apache 2.0 license). You can find it in the <code>monodevelop</code> subdirectory.</li>
  <li>Online repositiory with a MonoDevelop package is available at: <a href="http://functional-variations.net/addin">http://functional-variations.net/addin</a>.<br />
    <em>(If you're a hacker, the easiest way to get it working is to add <code>FSharp.Compiler*</code> to GAC and set <code>FSHARP_COMPILER_BIN</code> environment
    variable to F# installation location)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to see some interesting uses of the F# MonoDevelop plugin, you can also watch 
  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/fsharpined/videos.aspx" type="external">my 
  talk at the F# in Education event</a>. In one demo, I used F# on Mac to play with a simple, composable
  functional 3D library. In another example I demonstrated how to asynchronously process stock 
  prices on Linux. The last demo, showing my <code>match!</code> extension didn't work all that well, because
  I had too many virtual machines running, but I'll blog about <code>match!</code> again sooner or later!</p>

<p>In addition to the F# plugin for MonoDevelop itself, I'd also like to mention two web sites that
  I've been working on and some interesting cross-platform F# screencasts...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx/">The Duality of Object and Event references</a></h1>
    
<p>Mathematical duality [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx
#duallinks">2</a>] 
  is a very useful and elegant concept that gives us a nice way of speaking
  about objects or structures that behave in some way exactly conversely. There
  is no clear definition of what <em>duality</em> is. However, the idea is that when we
  have two structures that behave conversely and we know that something is true
  about the first one, then we get the opposite statement about the other structure
  "for free" (if you know how to translate from one structure to the other).</p>

<p>In this article, I'll talk about an interesting example of duality that (to my best
  knowledge) wasn't described by anyone before. The two dual structures are 
  <strong>references between objects</strong> in a normal program and <strong>references
  between events</strong> in a reactive application. The statement that is going to 
  become obvious thanks to the duality principle is describing which of the objects (or
  events) are garbage and can be safely collected by garbage collector.</p>

<p>This topic is in much more details 
  discussed in a paper [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx
#duallinks">4</a>] I wrote with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/dsyme/">Don Syme</a> 
  and that I presented at the ISMM Workshop (see also <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/pldi-2010-trip.aspx">my
  trip report from PLDI</a>). In this article, I'll try to give an accessible
  description of the most interesting idea from the paper...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/pldi-2010-trip.aspx/">PLDI 2010 Trip Report</a></h1>
    
<p>In June, I attended my first "big" academic conference <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/pldi10" type="external">Programming 
  Languages Design and Implementation (PLDI 2010)</a> in Toronto. I attended the conference, because
  I presented a paper that I wrote with Don Syme as a result of my internship at Microsoft Research, but
  I'll write more about that shortly (and thanks to MSR for partly supporting my attendance at the conference!)</p>
  
<p>As far as I understand it, the 
  focus of the conference is more on <em>implementation</em>. Many people believe that the current 
  programming languages are good enough and we need to make sure that they run well (e.g. compilers 
  optimize code to run better on multi-core) and that we need better tools for working with them 
  (e.g. automatic verification of the code we write), so these areas were the main focus of the
  conference. However, there were some very interesting talks on the <em>design</em> of programming 
  languages, which is an area that I personally find more interesting...

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/custom-linq-grouping.aspx/">Using custom grouping operators in LINQ</a></h1>
    
<p>You can use LINQ to write queries that perform grouping of data using <code>group by</code>
  or ordering of data using <code>orderby</code> clause. LINQ provides the default
  (and the most common) implementation of both of the operations, but sometimes you 
  may need a slightly different behavior when grouping or ordering data (this article
  is motivated by a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2194761/can-i-use-linq-to-retrieve-only-on-change-values" type="external">question on StackOverflow</a>
  which needs to do exactly that for grouping).</p>
  
<p>Let's look at a simple example, which shows when we may need a different behavior when 
  grouping data. For example, we may have the following list of stock trades
  containing a name of a stock and the price of the trade (stored for example as a list
  of <code>TradeInfo</code> classes with properties <code>Name</code> and <code>Price</code>):</p>  
<pre lang="csharp">
{ { Name = "MSFT", Price = 80.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 70.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 100.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 200.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 300.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 30.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 20.00 } }</pre>  
<p>Now, we may want to group adjacent trades into a single summary record which will contain
  the name of the stock (which is same for all trades in each group), the number of trades 
  in the group and an average price in the group. The desired results are:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
{ { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 75.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Count = 3, AvgPrice = 200.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 25.00 } }</pre>  
<p>The operation that we want to do is very similar to <code>group by</code> in LINQ, but 
  it doesn't do quite the same thing! If we used <code>group by</code>, we would get only 
  two groups as the result. However, as I wrote earlier, we want to group only 
  <em>adjacent trades</em>. You could write your own extension method to do this,
  but then you need to leave the elegant LINQ query syntax. In this article, I'll show
  you how to get the desired results using a simple LINQ query with a <code>group by</code>
  clause...</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx/">Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations</a></h1>
    
<p>In this article series, we're talking about the Accelerator project and I'm 
  presenting an F# library that I implemented, which allows you to use Accelerator [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx#accelfsh4links">references</a>]
  in a more sophisticated way. We've seen two examples of using Accelerator directly
  (see also <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">introduction</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">Game of Life</a>).
  In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx">previous article</a>
  I introduced my F# library for working with Accelerator. We've seen F# functions from the
  <code>DataParallel</code> module, we implemented an algorithm that rotates an image
  using these functions and finally, we've seen that we can take this ordinary F# code
  and run it using Accelerator. This is all possible thanks to F# quotations, which 
  we can use to get an AST (a source code) of an F# function we wrote (if the function
  is marked in some special way).</p>
  
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-quotations/blur.png" alt="Blurred photo of Prague" style="float:right; margin:10px" />
<p>In this part of the series, we're going to look at working with quotations explicitly.
  We'll use meta-programming techniques to work with Accelerator. Meta-programming means
  writing programs that manipulate with other programs or pieces of code. This is exactly
  what we're going to do in this article. We'll write an F# function (running on CPU) that
  builds a program, which we'll then run using Accelerator.</p>
<p>This is quite interesting approach, which isn't possible when we call Accelerator
  methods as standard F# functions or .NET methods. The benefit is that we'll 
  clearly see which parts of program run on CPU and what parts execute on GPU or using
  X64 multi-core target. We could also perform more complicated optimizations with 
  the code (because this wouldn't affect the readability). Just for your reference, here is the list
  of articles in this series in case you missed some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">Accelerator and F# (I.): Introduction and calculating PI</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">Accelerator and F# (II.): The Game of Life on GPU</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx">Accelerator and F# (III.): Data-parallel programs using F# quotations</a></li>
  <li><strong>Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations</strong></li>
</ul>  
<p>However, enough with theory and let's take a look at some code samples! 
  This time, we'll implement blurring of an image (also called convolution). 
  Another example how to write this in F# using Accelerator is Satnam Singh's blog 
  post [<a href="#accelfsh4links">4</a>]. Our example will be different, because we'll
  write the code as standard F# program and then have it translated to Accelerator
  automatically using quotations. We'll also talk about the architecture
  of the library that we're using and look at some performance results.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx/">Accelerator and F# (III.): Data-parallel programs using F# quotations</a></h1>
    
<p>If you've been following this article series, you already know 
  that Accelerator is a MSR library [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx#accelfsh3links">1</a>, <a href="#accelfsh3links">2</a>] 
  that allows you to run code in parallel on either multi-core CPU or using 
  shaders on GPU (see <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">introduction</a>).
  We also discussed a direct way to use Accelerator from F# (by calling Accelerator methods
  directly) and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">implemented Conway's Game of Life</a>.
  In this article, we'll look at more sophisticated way of using Accelerator from F#.
  We'll introduce F# quotations and look at translating 'normal' F# code to use
  Accelerator.</p>
  
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-dataparallel/rotated.png" alt="Rotated Prague photo" style="float:right; margin:10px" />

<p>In general, F# quotations allow us to treat F# code as data structure and manipulate 
  with it. This is very similar to C# expression trees, but the F# implementation is 
  more powerful. We can also mark a standard method or a function with a special attribute
  that tells the compiler to store quotation of the body. Then we can access the
  quotation and traverse it or modify it. In this article we'll use a function that
  takes an F# quotation (containing a limited set of functions) and executes it using
  MSR Accelerator. Implementing this functionality is a bit complicated, so we won't
  discuss the implementation now. We'll leave this for some future article of this series.
  In future, we'll also look at other interesting possibilities that we have when 
  writing code using quotations. Here is a list of articles in this series and of the
  articles that I'm planning to add:</p>

<p>In the <a href="accelerator-intro.aspx">previous article</a>, I introduced the
  Microsoft Research Accelerator library. It allows us to write computations with arrays
  in C# and execute them in parallel on multi-core CPU or more interestingly, 
  using GPU shaders. In the previous artcile, we've seen how Accelerator works and 
  how it can be accessed from F#. In this article, we'll look at one more interesting
  F# demo - we'll implement the famous Conway's Game of Life [<a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx#accelfsh2links">1</a>] using Accelerator.
  We'll use a v2 version of Accelerator which has been announced just recently and
  is available from Microsoft Connect [<a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx#accelfsh2links">2</a>].</p>

<p>This article is the second one from a series about using Accelerator from F#. 
  Today, we'll use Accelerator types directly from F# - this is the simplest possible 
  approach and is very similar to the way you'd work with Accelerator in C#. However, 
  we can use some nice F# features such as custom operators to make the code more 
  readable. In the next article, we'll discuss a different approach - we'll look how
  to execute more "standard" F# code (that doesn't reference Accelerator explicitly)
  with Accelerator using F# quotations. The list of articles may change, but here is 
  a list of articles that I'm currently planning to write:</p>

<p>I already wrote about two projects that I worked on during an internship at
  MSR back in 2007 (<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-in-fsharp.aspx" type="external">ASP.NET support in F#</a> and
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebtools-intro.aspx" type="external">F# WebTools</a>).
  Even though this was more than 2 years ago (and I did one more internship at MSR in the meantime),
  I still have one more project that I never published on the web. The folks from the F# team
  reminded me of this project recently, so I thought I could finally publish it. The project 
  used Microsoft Research Accelerator [<a href="#accelfsh1links">1</a>, <a href="#accelfsh1links">2</a>], 
  which is a C# library for developing array-based computations and executing them on a GPU. 
  More recently, the Accelerator team at MSR published Accelerator v2 [<a href="#accelfsh1links">3</a>],
  which was a good motivation to update my original project...</p>
  
<p>In this article, we'll look at the simplest way of using Accelerator from F#. Accelerator
  provides a managed interface that can be naturally used from both C# and F#. We can use
  a mix of method calls and overloaded operators to describe a computation. In F#, we'll also 
  define our additional custom operators to make the code a bit nicer. After we introduce
  Accelerator using a simple C# demo, we'll look how to calculate an approximate value of
  the PI number using a Monte-Carlo method.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-i-return.aspx/">Imperative computation in F# (I.) - Returning results from a function</a></h1>
    
<p>One of the limitations of F# is that it doesn't very well support some of the 
  advanced imperative language constructs such as <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>
  or imperative style of returning value from a function, meaning that you can't write
  something like <code>return false</code> in the middle of the function. This has 
  good reasons. F# doesn't in principle have the notion of <em>currently executing statement</em>
  and instead treat every code you write as an expression. Clearly, when there is no 
  <em>current statement</em>, we cannot jump to other statements. If you're looking
  for more information about these basic principles, you can take a look at my book 
  <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external">Real World Functional 
  Programming</a>, which covers this distinction in details in chapter 2, but we'll look 
  at a brief example that will clarify this idea shortly.</p>

<p>Often, there is really no need to use <code>break</code> or other imperative constructs
  in F#, because you can write the same thing more elegantly using one of the provided higher
  order function such as <code>Seq.exists</code> or <code>Seq.tryfind</code>. However,
  there are still some cases where the imperative programming style makes it easier 
  to express our original intention. Also, implementing your own higher order
  functions (akin to <code>Seq.exists</code>) would sometimes be much easier if we
  could just use imperative return.</p>  
<p>So, what can be done about this?</p>

<p>I started working on this project, because I attended C++ class at our university and I had to do some application in C++. Because I hate doing useless projects I wanted to work on something interesting and so I started thinking whether it would be possible to enable LINQ support in C++/CLI...</p>

<p>C++/CLI is a very flexible language and the following example proves that enabling LINQ support in C++/CLI isn't impossible. The following database query returns name of contact and company for all customers living in London:</p>

<pre lang="c++">
// create connection to database
NorthwindData db(".. connection string ..");

// declare database query
Expr&lt;Customers^&gt; cvar = Var&lt;Customers^&gt;("c");
CQuery&lt;String^&gt;^ q = db.QCustomers
  -&gt;Where(clq::fun(cvar, cvar.City == "London"))
  -&gt;Select(clq::fun(cvar, 
      cvar.ContactName + Expr&lt;String^&gt;(", ") + cvar.CompanyName));

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp3-concepts.aspx/">Concepts behind the C# 3.0 language</a></h1>
    
<p>One of the lectures that I attended last year was <a href="http://www.mff.cuni.cz/toISO-8859-2.en/vnitro/is/sis/predmety/kod.php?kod=PRG003">Programming Methodology and Philosophy of Programming Languages</a>. The lecture was mostly about history of programming languages and how several features evolved, disappeared and than after many years appeared again in another programming language.</p>

<p>As I final work I decided to write an article that describes ideas that influenced the design of the C# 3.0 language. Some of these features are known from functional languages (for example from LISP or Haskell), some other were developed at Microsoft Research and appeared in the F# language or Cω. I also wanted to show in what ways are these features limited in the C# 3.0. I think that thanks to these limitation, the C# 3.0 is still a simple (or at least not difficult) to understand which is very important for mainstream language, but I find it interesting to know what is possible in other (less limited) languages.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-slides-and-demos.aspx/">Slides and demos from F# presentation</a></h1>
    
<p>This semester I attended Advanced .NET Seminar that was led by <a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/">Tomas Matousek</a> [<a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/" target="_blank">^</a>] who is one of the authors of <a href="http://www.php-compiler.net">Phalanger project</a> [<a href="http://www.php-compiler.net" target="_blank">^</a>] (Which is an amazing project by the way. It takes PHP source code and compiles it without any modification to .NET).
Seminar was mostly focused on Rotor and .NET internals, so if you want to learn more about these topics you can look at <a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/Teaching/CLR.htm">Advanced .NET programming</a> [<a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/Teaching/CLR.htm" target="_blank">^</a>] slides (by Tomas Matousek).</p>
<p>I did one presentation at this seminar too. It was about the F# language developed at Microsoft Research. It was just a quick overview of F# features, because F# is very rich topic, so it coveres only the language (functional vs. imperative behavior), F# type system, compilation of F# constructs to .NET and interoperability with .NET (for example how to create windows forms application in F#). At the end, I also mentioned F# meta-programming that allows you to look at F# code as data.</p>
