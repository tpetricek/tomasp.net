    <h1>Reactive programming (II.) - Introducing Reactive LINQ</h1>
<p>In this article I'm going to introduce my project <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>. This is largely inspired
  by the ideas that come from functional reactive programming in the Haskell language and from 
  functionality that's available for working in events in F#. I introduced these ideas in my previous article
  in this mini-series, so if you're interested in learning more about these interesting technologies, you 
  should definitely read the previous article about <a href="/blog/reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">First class events in F#</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we're going to look how to apply the same ideas to the C# language and how 
  to use LINQ queries for processing events. This article is <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx">just</a>&#160;<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx">another</a> my article that shows how to implement some 
  idea from functional programming in C#. I believe this will once again show that the new features
  in the C# 3.0 aren't just about querying databases, but are more widely useful even in situations 
  that are not directly related to data-processing. </p>  

<h3>The idea: Event is a stream</h3>
<p>The key idea that is important for the project is that we can look at .NET events in a different way.
  We can say that events are actually streams that carry some values, even though these values are not 
  available all the time. They appear in the stream once in a while when the event occurs.
  Let's take for example a <code>MouseDown</code> event. This can be viewed as a stream that contains 
  information about mouse clicks - the button together with X and Y location. A new value in the stream 
  appears every time user clicks on the control. Now that we have a stream of values, you can see that 
  this is quite similar to for example a collection of values. 
</p>

<h2>Processing events with queries</h2>
<img src="/articles/reactive/maze_screen.png" alt="Form with a maze bitmap" style="float:right; margin:15px;"/>
<p>I'll show you a simple example first and then we're going to look how things work behind the scene.
  We'll write a very simple game - the form will show you a maze (just like the one you can see on the
  screenshot) and your goal will be to move the mouse cursor from the starting point (on the left) to the 
  target point (on the right). You have to follow the white path and if you move the cursor on the grass, 
  the game ends.</p>
<p>Our implementation will be very simple - it will load the bitmap into the memory and every time 
  you move the mouse, it will check whether the mouse is still on the path (I guess you could cheat if 
  you moved the mouse quickly, but that's not the point now!)</p>  
<p>In the usual C# programming style, you'd register an event handler for the <code>MouseMove</code>
  event and implemented a method that reads the color from the bitmap and tests whether the 
  color is white. If not, it would show a message and set some flag to end the game. Then it would check 
  whether we're close to the target point and if yes, it would display some congratulations box.
  We'll implement the same thing using two <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> queries.</p>
  
<h3>Following the path</h3>  
<p>The first query will test whether the cursor is still on the path (by checking the color below the cursor).
  This means that we'll take the event stream coming from the <code>MouseMove</code> event. A value will
  appear in the stream whenever the cursor position changes. In the first part, we're interested only in
  the cases where the cursor moved out of the path, so we'll use the <code>where</code> clause to filter
  values that are on the path. Let's take a look at the first part of the code:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
// Move cursor to the start location and load the bitmap
Cursor.Position = this.PointToScreen(new Point(150, 200));
Bitmap bmp = (Bitmap)this.BackgroundImage;

// Create stream for the 'MouseMove' event and
// filter events when the mouse cursor is on the path
var eOut =
  from me in this.AttachEvent&lt;MouseEventArgs&gt;("MouseMove")
  let clr = bmp.GetPixel(me.X, me.Y)
  where clr.R != 255 || clr.G != 255 || clr.B != 255
  select "Oops!\nYou stepped on the grass!";
</pre>  
<p>We start by loading the bitmap and by moving the cursor to the starting position in the maze.
  The second statement is much more interesting. It is a LINQ query that processes values called
  <code>me</code>. The type of <code>me</code> is <code>MouseEventArgs</code>, which suggests that
  the value is created every time the user moves the mouse. The source of these values is
  created using <code>AttachEvent</code> method. In an ideal world, we could just write 
  <code>this.MouseMove</code>, but in C# you can't use event as an object (for example as a method argument),
  so the  <code>AttachEvent</code> method contains some reflection code to create a value that 
  represents the event. I'll talk about these values in a second.</p>
<p>Once we have <code>MouseEventArgs</code> value available, we can use its properties to
  check whether the cursor is still following the path. We first use the LINQ <code>let</code> clause to 
  store the color in a variable <code>clr</code> and then use <code>where</code> to test whether the 
  color is other than white. Once the user moves the mouse out of the path, this becomes true and
  the <code>select</code> clause is triggered. It simply returns a message that we want to show 
  to the user.</p>
<h3>Reactive LINQ under the hood</h3>  
<p>Under the hood, this is translated to an expression that calls <code>Where</code> and <code>Select</code>
  LINQ operators and looks roughly like this (the <code>let</code> clause makes it a bit difficult, but
  we don't have to care about that, because we're interested only in the structure):</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var eOut = 
  this.AttachEvent&lt;MouseEventArgs&gt;("MouseMove")
    .Where(args =&gt; /* some lambda expression */ )
    .Select(args =&gt; /* some lambda expression */ );          
</pre>  
<p>This means, that we create some representation of event using <code>AttachEvent</code> and the 
  <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> library provides standard LINQ query operators for this representation.
  Both <code>Where</code> and <code>Select</code> take an event and a function as arguments and return
  a new event. The type that I use for representing events is an interface type called <code>IEvent&lt;T&gt;</code>.
  This interface has methods for adding and removing event handlers, but you'll typically never use them directly,
  because you can work with it using operators like <code>Where</code> and others.</p>
<p>The <code>AttachEvent</code> method is added as an extension method to Windows Forms controls and takes 
  a name of the event as an argument. You also have to specify the specific <code>EventArgs</code> type used
  with this event. The result in our previous example is <code>IEvent&lt;MouseEventArgs&gt;</code>.
  This represents an event that gives us <code>MouseEventArgs</code> value when it is triggered. Then we
  use two LINQ operators that do the following thing:</p>  
<ul>
  <li><strong>Where</strong> takes an event that gives us value of type <code>TValue</code> and a delegate 
    (lambda expression). The result of this operator is an event that contains the same value <code>TValue</code>,
    but it is triggered only when the delegate returns true. In our maze example, the event returned by <code>Where</code>
    will be triggered only when user moves out of the path.</li>
  <li><strong>Select</strong> transforms an event that gives values of type <code>TSource</code> into an 
    event that gives values of type <code>TTarget</code>. It takes a function that knows how to create the 
    target value from the source value. The returned event is triggered each time the source one is triggered.
    In our example, the function simply returns the same <code>string</code> value and ignores the 
    <code>MouseEventArgs</code> that it gets as an argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the overall result of the LINQ query from the previous example is <code>IEvent&lt;string&gt;</code>.
  This event is triggered when the user mouse the cursor out of the path and it will contain a string value (a message)
  that we want to show to the user. We'll do this in the next section.</p>

<h3>Reacting to events</h3>  
<p>We'll first implement a handler that will show a message box when the user fails and later we'll finish the 
  second part of the game, which is testing whether the cursor is close to the target point. Adding handler to 
  the event value <code>eOut</code> is quite easy:</p>  
<pre lang="csharp">
eOut.Listen(str =&gt; MessageBox.Show(str));
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>This uses another operator (extension method) available for the <code>IEvent&lt;T&gt;</code> type, which is 
  called <code>Listen</code>. Similarly as <code>Event.listen</code> in F# (see the previous part of this series)
  this can be used at the end of the event query. It will be called when the event is raised and it can 
  react to the event in any way. In our example, we use a lambda expression that takes the string 
  (that is the message coming from the event) and displays it using <code>MessageBox.Show</code>.</p>

<h2>Combining multiple events</h2>
<img src="/articles/reactive/maze_win.png" alt="Message after finishing the maze" style="float:right; margin:15px;"/>
<p>The code for testing whether the mouse is close to the target point will be very similar to the 
  query we've seen earlier. Only the condition that tests whether the event should be triggered 
  (written using <code>where</code>) will differ. Again, we'll write this as an event that gives
  us a <code>string</code> value when it occurs, so it makes a good sense to reuse the part that 
  shows the message to the user.</p>

<h3>Testing the target point</h3>
<p>Let's start with the query. Similarly as in the first case, it'll query values comming from the
  <code>MouseMove</code> event. Next, it calculates the distance between the target point, which is 
  <code>(450, 250)</code> and the current mouse location <code>(me.X, me.Y)</code>. We'll test 
  whether this distance is small enough and if yes, we'll trigger the event with a message that 
  the game was successfully completed:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Filter events when mouse is far from the target
// if the cursor is close, we return a message 
var eFinish =
  from me in this.AttachEvent&lt;MouseEventArgs&gt;("MouseMove")
  let dist = Math.Pow(450 - me.X, 2) + 
             Math.Pow(250 - me.Y, 2)
  where dist &lt; 250
  select "Congratulations!\nYou made it to the end!";
</pre>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the query is essentially the same as the first one, with the exception
  that it has a different condition and returns a different message. An important thing to note is 
  that the <code>eFinish</code> value has the same type as the <code>eOut</code> value - both of 
  them are <code>IEvent&lt;string&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>Merging events</h3>
<p>So far, we have two events - one that gives us a message when the user fails and the second one 
  that gives us a message when the user succeeds. The reaction to both of the events will be exactly
  the same. We'll display the message and then stop further processing of the events, because we 
  don't want to show the messages again (we ignored this issue in the first version).</p>
<p>Because we want to use a single handler for both of the events, we'd like to combine 
  them into a single event in some way. This can be done using <code>Merge</code> method 
  from the static class <code>Reactive</code>. This class contains various other methods
  for working with events and we'll talk about some of them in later parts of this series.
  Once we combine the events, we can again use <code>Listen</code> to write the code that
  reacts to the event. Note that if you're writing the code, you'll need to remove the previous line 
  where we implemented a reaction to the <code>eOut</code> event, because now we'll react
  to both of the events at once:</p>  

<pre lang="csharp">
// Wait for either of the events
// then stop all processing and show the message
var eMerged = Reactive.Merge(eOut, eFinish);
eMerged.First().Listen(str =&gt; MessageBox.Show(str));
</pre>
<p>We start by merging the events into an event called <code>eMerged</code>. This event has again a type
  <code>IEvent&lt;string&gt;</code>. It will be triggered whenever <em>either</em> of the two merged events 
  is triggered. This means that the <code>eMerged</code> event will be triggered when the user moves outside
  of the path or when the cursor is close to the target point (possibly several times).
  However, we're only interested in the first occurrence. Once either of these two occurs, we 
  just want to show the message box and we're not interested in any further events. This can 
  be written using another LINQ operator called <code>First</code>. The event returned 
  by <code>First</code> will be triggered only once, so we can react to this event using 
  <code>Listen</code>.</p>  

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we've looked at the basic examples of my <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> project.
  This project is largely inspired by functional reactive programming in Haskell [<a href="#react2links">1</a>]
  and also by first-class events in the F# language [<a href="#react2links">2</a>]. I wrote about the 
  F# implementation in the previous series, so if you skipped that, you may want to read it too.</p>
<p>We looked at the basic query operators that <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> provides for events.
  In particular, we've looked at <code>Where</code> and <code>Select</code> that can be accessed 
  using the nice LINQ query syntax and at combinators like <code>First</code> (for selecting the first event),
  <code>Merge</code> (for merging a couple of events) and <code>Listen</code> (for reacting to an event).
  In the next series, we're going to look at some more very useful operators for working with events and 
  in particular at <em>switching</em> operators that allow us to change the way events are handled 
  dynamically.</p>
<h3>Downloads and implementation notes</h3>
<p>The current implementation is really just a prototype to demonstrate the idea. This means that it 
  probably still contains many issues. One of the possible issues is with removing event handlers 
  when they are not needed anymore. For example, after the <code>First</code> operator is triggered 
  for the first time, it needs to unregister itself from the source event, because it doesn't need
  to listen to them anymore. Currently, this is implemented using reference-counting like technique. 
  This means that events count how many listeners they have and they unregister when there is no 
  listener. This is of course problematic, because you may create loops. In the future, I'd like 
  to make the implementation more stable and I'm planning to take a look at the Weak Event Pattern [<a href="#react2links">3</a>], 
  which is used in WPF. Since this is a prototype, feel free to do anything with it and let me know 
  if you have any suggestions or ideas how it could be improved! </p>
