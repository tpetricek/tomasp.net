        <h1>Asynchronous C# and F# (I.): Simultaneous introduction</h1>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/csharp-fsharp-async-intro/pdc2010.png" style="float:right;margin:5px;margin-left:20px;" />
<p>One of the exciting new technologies that was announced at <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/">PDC 2010</a>
  is the support for <em>asynchronous programming</em> in C#. So what exactly is <em>asynchronous programming</em>?
  Many applications today need to connect to some service or external data source including, for example, 
  Web Services and REST APIs. This calls may take a long time to run, but we want to run them without
  blocking the application.</p>

<p>Currently, you can run the operation on a background thread or using a <code>Task</code>, but
  coordinating multiple such operations is difficult. What if you for example need to wait until
  any (or all) of downloads complete and run some more code then? This is not only difficult, but
  it also scales badly, because blocking .NET threads is a bad practice (Threads are expensive and when
  they're just waiting for other operation to complete, we're wasting valuable resources).
  This problem has been the main motivation for including <em>asynchronous workflows</em> in F#
  about 3 years ago. In F#, this also enabled various interesting programming styles - for example
  <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx" type="external">creating 
  GUI using asynchronous workflows</a> (also discussed in Chapter 16 of <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">my book</a> and in 
  in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx">my recent talk</a>). The C# asynchronous 
  programming support and the <code>await</code> keyword is largely inspired by
  F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em> (I was quite surprised that F# wasn't more visibly 
  mentioned in the PDC talk).
</p>

<p>In this article series, I'll demonstrate both F# and C# asynchronous programming model,
  I'll look at features that are missing in one or the other as well as a few subtle differences
  (that may be unexpected) and finally, I'll write about writing (asynchronous) F# libraries 
  that are easy to use from C#. The plan for the series is following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous C# and F# (I.): Simultaneous introduction</strong></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (II.): How do they differ?</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-compilation-internals.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</a></li>  <li>Asynchronous C# and F# (IV.): Calling F# libraries from C# <em>(not yet available)</em></li>
</ul>  
<p>Let's start with a brief overview of asynchronous programming features in C# and F#...</p>

<h2>Introducing C# await construct</h2>
<p>Perhaps the best example to demonstrate asynchronous programming on .NET is implementing a method
  to download the content of a web page. In practice, this can be done easily using <code>WebClient</code>,
  but it works well as a demo. In the implementation, we need to get HTTP response and then 
  read data from the stream repeatedly in a loop into a buffer.</p>

<p>Writing the code using <code>BeginGetResponse</code> and <code>BeginRead</code> methods is
  quite difficult. We can pass lambda function as an argument, but there isn't an easy way of
  implementing the looping. The problem is that the iteration is started in one scope,
  but continues in a different scope (the body of the lambda). As a result, we cannot use 
  any standard control-flow constructs such as <code>while</code>, <code>for</code> but also
  <code>try</code> ... <code>catch</code>.</p>

<h3>Downloading page asynchronously</h3>

<p>If the feature makes it into C# 5.0 (which I would expect) then we'll be able to write the same 
  thing more easily using the <code>await</code>
  construct. The following snippet shows the initialization of the HTTP request - we'll
  discuss the actual downloading in the next snippet.</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
async Task&lt;Tuple&lt;string, int&gt;&gt; DownloadPage(string url) {
  // Create web request to download a web site
  var request = HttpWebRequest.Create(url);
  // Asynchronously obtain the HTTP response
  using (var response = await request.GetResponseAsync()) {
    // Start reading the response stream
    using (var stream = response.GetResponseStream()) {
      // TODO: Asynchronously copy content of the stream
      // TODO: Read 'html' content and extract 'title'
      return Tuple.Create(title, html.Length);
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The method creates a web request and then obtains a HTTP response from the server.
  It uses the usual <code>using</code> statement to ensure that all created 
  objects will be disposed. At the first look, it looks like a completely ordinary
  C# method, but it is not. There are two important differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom:10px"><strong>The <code>async</code> keyword and <code>Task</code> return type</strong> - the return type of the method
    is <code>Task&lt;Tuple&lt;string, int&gt;&gt;</code>, but there is no task created
    anywhere in the method. It just creates a tuple and returns it using the 
    <code>return</code> statement. This would look like an error, but the method 
    is also marked with <code>async</code> keyword.</li>

  <li><strong>The <code>await</code> keyword</strong> - when getting the response in the 
    second <code>using</code> statement, we use the new keyword <code>await</code> and
    we call an asynchronous variant of the method named <code>GetResponseAsync</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two changes above turn a usual method into an <em>asynchronous method</em>. 
  When called, the asynchronous method starts running, but returns a task before it completes.
  The caller can then do some other work before waiting for the result of the call. 
  The waiting is done using the new <code>await</code> construct. The construct can appear
  almost anywhere in an expression and we can use it to obtain the result of a <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> 
  or to wait until <code>Task</code> completes.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant:small-caps; margin:15px 50px 3px 50px">Blocking and non-blocking waiting</h3>
<p style="margin:0px 50px 15px 50px">There is an important difference between writing <code>task.Result</code> and <code>await task</code>.
  In the first case, the <code>Result</code> property simply blocks the thread until the 
  task completes and produces result. On the other hand, the <code>await</code> construct
  is handled in a special way by the C# compiler. The compiler translates the method into a 
  state machine and replaces all uses of <code>await</code> with code that sets a <em>continuation</em>
  of a task and returns. A continuation is simply a function that will be called when the
  task completes and will continue running the body of the method. This requires quite a bit
  of reorganization in the body of the method and it is not something that can be easily done by
  hand. The key point is that using <code>await</code> will not block any thread. </p>

<p>Let's now look at the second snippet. It shows a loop that asynchronously downloads
  the page content using 1kB buffer. When it completes, it extracts
  title of the page and returns it together with the length of the page:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Regular expression for extracting page title
Regex regTitle = new Regex(@@"\&lt;title\&gt;([^\&lt;]+)\&lt;/title\&gt;");

// Create a buffer and stream to copy data to
var buffer = new byte[1024];
var temp = new MemoryStream();
int count;
do {
  // Asynchronously read next 1kB of data
  count = await stream.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
  // Write data to memory stream
  temp.Write(buffer, 0, count);
} while (count &gt; 0);

// Read data as string and find page title
temp.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
var html = new StreamReader(temp).ReadToEnd();
var title = regTitle.Match(html).Groups[1].Value;
return Tuple.Create(title, html.Length);
</pre>

<p>Again, this looks like a completely normal C# code with a loop inside.
  The interesting thing is that we use <code>await</code> inside the loop to 
  implement asynchronous waiting. We start by initializing the buffer and 
  a memory stream where we copy the downloaded data. Inside the loop, we start
  reading from the HTTP stream into a 1kB buffer. This may take some time, so 
  we use asynchronous version of the operation <code>ReadAsync</code>, which
  returns <code>Task&lt;int&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>When the reading completes, the system calls a callback that we provided and the callback runs a
  continuation generated by the C# compiler. The continuation runs the rest of the loop body,
  checks the condition and then jumps either to the start of the loop (again) or to the code
  after the loop.</p>

<h3>Starting asynchronous operations</h3>
<p>Let's now look how we can run the method for a couple of URLs in parallel and 
  collect all the results. The C# language doesn't provide any direct <em>language</em>
  support for doing that, but we can easily do that using a library. The library that is
  distributed with the C# preview contains a class <code>TaskEx</code> (I guess it would be 
  merged with standard <code>Task</code> class in a new .NET). The task has a very useful
  method named <code>WhenAll</code>:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
async static Task ComparePages() {
  var urls = new[] { "http://www.google.com",
    "http://www.bing.com", "http://www.yahoo.com", };
  var downloads = urls.Select(DownloadPage);
  var results = await TaskEx.WhenAll(downloads);
  foreach (var item in results)
    Console.WriteLine("{0} (length {1})", item.Item1, item.Item2);
}
static void Main() {
  ComparePages().Wait();
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>WhenAll</code> method (corresponding to <code>Async.Parallel</code> in F#) takes 
  a collection of <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> objects and creates a single task that waits until
  all the tasks given as an argument complete and returns the results in an array. The return type
  of the method is <code>Task&lt;T[]&gt;</code>. In the code snippet above, we just create a list
  of URLs and use the <code>Select</code> method to call <code>DownloadPage</code> for every
  URL. The result is an array of tasks that are downloading the specified web pages.</p>
<p>Next, we use the <code>await</code> keyword again to wait until the aggregating task completes
  (meaning that all downloads have completed). As a result, we get an array that contains
  tuples returned by <code>DownloadPage</code>, so we can simply iterate over the values in the
  array and print the title of the page with the total size in bytes.</p>
<p>The method <code>ComparePages</code> is again implemented as an asynchronous method
  (meaning that it is marked with <code>async</code> and returns <code>Task</code>). It doesn't
  return any result, but it runs in the background and eventually completes and prints the results.
  Since <code>Main</code> cannot be asynchronous, we cannot call it using <code>await</code>, but
  we can use the standard <code>Wait</code> method of the <code>Task</code> type to block the
  program until the operation finishes. It is worth noting that when we call <code>ComparePages</code>,
  the operation already starts downloading the web pages, so if your application needs to do
  something else, you can just call the method and discard the returned <code>Task</code> object.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant:small-caps; margin:15px 50px 3px 50px">Why do we need asynchronous programming?</h3>
<p style="margin:0px 50px 15px 50px">You may be wondering why we need asynchronous programming
  in the previous example at all. Why can't we just create three threads and run every operation
  on a separate thread. If we did that, an operation would occupy the thread for the entire time
  needed to download the page. On the other hand, with asynchronous support, a thread is needed only
  to run the processing code. An operation called using <code>await</code> is handled by the system
  and it will resume the code (and start using some thread) only after it completes. This means
  that when using asynchronous model, the above code could easily run just on a single thread, even
  when downloading larger number of pages such as 50.</p>

<h2>Using F# asynchronous workflows</h2>
<p>Let's now look at the same problem implemented in F#. Asynchronous programming support is
  not built directly into the F# language. It is implemented using <em>computation expressions</em>,
  which is a general purpose feature for writing computations with some <em>non-standard</em>
  aspect. In F#, the same language feature can be used for sequence expressions (similar to 
  iterators and <code>yield return</code>) and <em>asynchronous workflows</em>.</p>

<h3>Downloading page asynchronously</h3>
<p>The .NET methods used and the control flow of the F# version is exactly the same. 
  The main difference is that I'm using a recursive function instead of <code>while</code>
  to implement the looping, but that's just a personal preference. I wanted to show an idiomatic
  functional solution (instead of an imperative <code>while</code> loop), but you can

<p>It is not difficult to see how this corresponds to the C# version we've seen before. The body of the 
  function is wrapped in an <code>async { ... }</code> block. Unlike in C#, this is not a hard-coded language 
  feature - <code>async</code> is not a keyword but a value defined in F# library that specifies what
  is special about the code block (in our case, the fact that it is asynchronous). The block constructs
  a value of type <code>Async&lt;string * int&gt;</code>, which represents an asynchronous computation
  that can be started and eventually returns a tuple.</p>

<p>The keywords with <em>bang</em> correspond to various uses of the <code>await</code> keyword in C#.
  We're using <code>use!</code> keyword to start an asynchronous operation and dispose of the returned object
  when the workflow completes, we're using <code>let!</code> to start an operation and bind the
  result to a value and finally, we're using <code>do!</code> to start operation that doesn't
  return any result. I'll discuss some of the differences between F# and C# later 
  (and in more details in an upcoming article). First, let's look how to start the computation...</p>

<h3>Starting asynchronous computations</h3>
<p>Just like in the C# version, we'll first write a function <code>comparePages</code> that downloads
  multiple pages in parallel and then prints all the results and returns. We'll write it as an <em>asynchronous
  workflow</em> representing the composed computation. Note that unlike in C#, the computation is not 
  started yet - we're just building a specification of what should be done. Once we have the workflow, 
  we can start it. In the following example we start it and wait until it completes:</p>

<p>The code is again very similar to the C# version earlier in the article. We create an array of 
  URLs, use <code>Array.map</code> to turn it into an array of asynchronous computations and then 
  compose the computations into a single one using <code>Async.Parallel</code>. This creates a composed
  computation that returns an array with all the results. To get the results we wait until the composed
  computation completes using <code>let!</code> Once that happens, we iterate over the results and 
  output them to the screen.</p>
<p>Unlike in C# (where asynchronous method returns a started task), the F# version just gives us a 
  specification of the work to be done. We can start it using various different methods. The method
  used in the example above is <code>Async.RunSynchronously</code>, which starts the workflow and blocks
  until it completes. However, the sub-tasks done by the workflow (3 distinct downloads) will be all
  started in parallel.</p>

<h2>Comparing C# and F# asynchronous model</h2>
<p>Now that we've seen the same problem implemented in both F# and C#, let's look at some of the
  similarities and differences between the two programming models. I'll write a separate article with
  more details and discussing some of the subtle and tricky differences, but I'd like to mention
  at least a few of them in this introduction.</p>

<h3>Similarities</h3>
<p>Let's start with the similarities. Obviously, the syntax is quite similar. The <code>await</code>
  keyword corresponds to several keywords from F# computation expressions depending on how it is
  used. The most common is <code>let!</code> and then also <code>use!</code> and <code>do!</code>
  These keywords are used to insert a special asynchronous call into code that is otherwise sequential.</p>
<p>There are also some very similar concepts in the libraries, in particular, for introducing 
  parallelism. There are two ways of adding parallelism using asynchronous programming model. One is 
  to compose multiple operations returning the same type (and running the same code) and the other one
  is to start and wait for tasks explicitly. For the F# way of doing this, see section 4.1 in The F# 
  Asynchronous Programming Model [<a href="csasynclinks">1</a>] article.</p>
<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Data-parallel</strong> programming model can be done using the <code>TaskEx.WhenAll</code> method 
    in C#. This method corresponds to <code>Async.Parallel</code> in F#. These two methods create a task or
    a workflow that runs multiple operations, waits until all of them complete and then returns all results.</li>
  <li><strong>Task-based</strong> parallelism in C# is done by creating new task (using <code>Task.Create</code>),
    which is started automatically and then waiting using <code>await</code>. In F#, the same thing is done
    using <code>Async.StartChild</code> (to start a workflow) and <code>let!</code> to wait for the completion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Differences</h3>
<p>Even though the programming model <em>looks</em> almost the same, there are some notable differences.
  I'll write a more detailed article about some of them, but here is an assorted list of those that
  I found quite important:</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Availability</strong>. This is not a techincal aspect, but it is perhaps the most important one.
    Asynchronous workflows in F# shipped in Visual Studio 2010 and you can use them now to write production code
    for a wide range of runtimes including .NET 2.0, Mono, Silverlight (see <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx">my talk</a>!) and even Windows Phone 7. 
    The bits released for C# are very early version and will (probably) ship with the next version 
    of Visual Studio. My guess is that they will also require a new version of .NET framework when finally released. </li>
  <li><strong>Running or Delayed?</strong> The F# programming model creates <code>Async&lt;T&gt;</code> which 
    is just a specification of what should be done. We can start it in various different ways (or we may not
    start it) and it can be quite nicely composed. The C# programming model works with <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>
    type, which means that <code>async</code> method creates a computation that is already running in background.
    The F# programming model definitely feels more suitable for functional (declarative) programming languages.
    I also think that it makes it easier to reason about what is going on. </li>
  <li><strong>Cancellation</strong>. When you want to implement a computation that can be cancelled in C#, you 
    need to explicitly pass <code>CancellationToken</code> object around and check whether a cancellation was
    requested. In F#, this is done automatically (and checks are made each time some asynchronous operation
    is executed (or when a language construct with special meaning is executed). Implementing the cancellation
    explicitly isn't as bad as writing everything using <code>BeginFoo</code>, but doing it properly
    is not as easy as it may sound (more about that later)</li>
  <li><strong>Waiting inside expressions</strong>. In C#, we can use <code>await</code> anywhere inside
    an expression, while in F#, <code>let!</code> cannot be nested. When you want to rewrite something like
    <code>await Foo(await Bar())</code> in F#, you first have to assign the result of <code>Bar</code> to 
    some local variable. This is a good thing for C#, because it makes writing of certain things easier.
    A slight disadvantage may be that it is not as easy to see when an asynchronous operation occurs in the
    expression (though it would be interesting to see this feature in F# too).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As far as I can tell, the asynchronous programming model in C# is largely based on F# <em>asynchronous 
  workflows</em>. It is wonderful to see how ideas from the F# language spread to the main-stream (although
  it would be nicer if this was more visibly acknowledged in the presentation). </p>
<p>This definitely doesn't mean that F# is not interesting anymore. There are many useful
  features in F# not related to asynchronous programming that would be difficult to imagine in C#. Even when 
  talking just about asynchronous programming, F# still has some features and libraries that make it more
  attractive. Two examples are implicit cancellation and a wonderful library for agent-based parallelism. Moreover,
  there are interesting new things in F# comming out at PDC 2010. There are also interesting research 
  projects (like <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">my pattern matching extension</a> [<a href="csasynclinks">3</a>]) 
  which would make F# even better for reactive, concurrent and asynchronous programming (but, just to be
  clear, that's a distant future).</p>
