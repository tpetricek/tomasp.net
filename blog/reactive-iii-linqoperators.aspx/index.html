    <h1>Reactive Programming (III.) - Useful Reactive LINQ Operators</h1>
<p>In the <a href="/blog/reactive-ii-csevents.aspx">previous article</a>, I introduced <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>.
  I explained the different point of view that we can use when working with .NET events. The idea is that
  .NET events can be viewed as streams of values. The value is information about the event (such as position
  of a mouse click or a mouse movement). These streams can be processed using LINQ queries - we can for example
  filter all values that are not interesting for us using <code>where</code> LINQ clause. For example if we want to handle
  clicks only in some specified area.</p>
<p>In the previous article, I talked about basic LINQ query operators such as <code>select</code> and <code>where</code>
  and some useful methods that <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> provides (for example for merging event streams).
  Today, we'll take a look at two more advanced kinds of operations that we can use for working with event streams. 
  In particular, we'll talk about aggregation operators (that you certainly know from LINQ) and about switching. 
  Switching is a concept from functional reactive programming and it allows us to change dynamically how the 
  application behaves. However, I'll explain this in a more detail soon.</p>
<p>In this article, I'm going to use mostly C# (and some Visual Basic). The functionality that I'm describing
  in this part isn't part of the standard F# <code>Event</code> module that I discussed in 
  <a href="/blog/reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">the first part</a>. I implemented most of them in F# too, but I'm not going
  to write the samples in both of the versions in this part. If you've seen the first two articles, you'll be 
  definitely able to use the F# versions as well, because they follow exactly the same ideas as the C#/LINQ versions.
  I'm going to talk about a larger demo application in the last section and I'll show an F# version as well,
  so you'll see some F# examples in the next part. This part serves more as a reference of the available
  operators, so you may read only some parts of it, then jump to the last one (to see an exciting example!) 
  and then come back here.</p>  

<h2>Aggregating event streams</h2>
<p>When working with data using LINQ, we can use various aggregation operators. These operators compute a single
  value from a collection of object. You can for example  use <code>Sum</code> to add prices of all products,
  <code>Max</code> to find the largest price or <code>Aggregate</code>, which is performs a custom aggregation
  specified by a lambda function.</p>

<p>As we'll see, these operations are quite useful for <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> as well. However, they'll
  have to behave a bit differently than for collections. When you have, for example, a collection of products, 
  you can easily calculate the total price. The collection has finite number of elements, so we can iterate over
  all of them. On the other hand, event streams aren't really finite or at least, you can't say when you
  reached the end. If you're processing for example mouse clicks, you can't tell whether the user will continue 
  clicking or not. The stream is finite in some sense - when the application is closed, the stream ends, but doing
  something (other than cleanup) when the application is closed doesn't look very useful!</p>
  
<p>Instead of returning a value at the end of the stream, our aggregation operators will yield the present
  value every time an event occurs and then continue with the aggregation. This means that aggregation operators
  will also return <code>IEvent&lt;T&gt;</code> and the event will be triggered every time the aggregated 
  value is updated. We can use this for example for counting number of clicks on a button.</p>

<h3>Counting clicks</h3>
<p>I believe that an example will make everything clear. In the following snippet, we'll attach an event to a 
  button and we'll use <code>Sum</code> to count the number of clicks on the button:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
btnClick.AttachEvent("Click")
  .Select(ea =&gt; 1).Sum().Listen(n =&gt; 
    lblOut.Text = String.Format("Current count is: {0}", n));
</pre>
<p>The usual call to <code>AttachEvent</code> is followed by a call to <code>Select</code>. The result of this
  call will be an event stream that will contain a number 1 every time the button is clicked.
  To get the total number of clicks on the button, we'll need to sum all the ones coming from the stream.
  The easiest way to do this is to use the <code>Sum</code> operator. The result of this operation is an
  event that is triggered every time the user clicks on the button. Values that will appear in this event
  stream will be the sum calculated from the values so far, which means that it will contain numbers 1, 2, 3, ...
  and that's the number of clicks that we want to display!</p>
  
<p>The fact that the result of aggregation in <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> isn't just a number, but an event 
  stream means that we can do multiple aggregations in a sequence. In the previous example, we've seen how
  to generate a sequence containing ascending sequence of integers. If we'll multiply all of them, we'll
  get the well known factorial function (the sequence of factorials will be 1, 1*2, 1*2*3, 1*2*3*4, ...).
  Calculating total value was easy, because we had <code>Sum</code> operator, but multiplication isn't
  built-in, so we'll have to use the generic <code>Aggregate</code> operation:</p>  
<pre lang="csharp">
btnClick.AttachEvent("Click")
  // Generates sequence of integers: 1, 2, 3, ...
  .Select(ea =&gt; 1).Sum() 
  // Generate sequence of factorials: 1, 1*2, 1*2*3, ...
  .Aggregate(1, (fact, current) =&gt; fact * current)
  .Listen(n =&gt; 
    lblOut.Text = String.Format("Factorial is: {0}", n));
</pre>
<p>The part ended with the call to <code>Sum</code> is same as in the previous example and it gives
  us a sequence of integers. When aggregating using the <code>Aggregate</code> operator, we'll need
  some initial value and we'll write a function that takes the current value from the stream and the
  previous result (starting with the initial) and produces a new result. In our example, the initial value
  is 1 (we don't want to multiply everything by zero!) and the function takes the current factorial 
  (<code>fact</code>) and multiplies it by the next value from the stream (<code>current</code>).
  Finally, we add a handler to show the results using <code>Listen</code>.</p>

<h3>Using Visual Basic Query syntax</h3>
<img src="/articles/reactive/vbcounter.png" alt="Counting clicks in Visual Basic" style="float:right; margin:15px;"/>
<p>The only way to write aggregation in C# is to use extension methods explicitly. Interestingly,
  in Visual Basic, there is query syntax for that as well using the <code>Aggregate</code> clause. 
  We'll take a look how to rewrite the first example (showing the number of clicks) in Visual Basic 
  using just a single query. First, we'll need a simple utility function for displaying the result,
  because Visual Basic has only limited support for lambda functions:
  </p>
<pre lang="basic">
' Utility function that allows us to set label text in the query easily
Function SetText(ByVal lbl As Label, ByVal str As String) As Integer
  lbl.Text = str
  Return 0
End Function
</pre>
<p>Now we can take a look at the query. This time we'll add reaction to the <code>MouseDown</code>
  event and we'll only count clicks that were made by the left button. In C#, we'd have to write
  this using a nested query, but in VB it can be written like this:</p>
<pre lang="basic">
' Count the number of clicks made by the left button
Dim eCount = _
  Aggregate ea In btnClick.AttachEvent(Of MouseEventArgs)("MouseDown") _
  Where ea.Button = MouseButtons.Left _
  Into Sum(1)
  
' Display the number using utility function 'SetText'
eCount.Listen(Function(n) SetText(lblOutput, _
  String.Format("Count: {0}", n)))
</pre>
<p>Visual Basic query that does aggregation starts with the <code>Aggregate</code> keyword and then 
  specifies what values will be aggregated. In our case, it is the value coming from the <code>MouseDown</code>
  event. This can be followed by various other LINQ clauses. We use just a single <code>Where</code> to
  filter only left button clicks. Finally, there is an <code>Into</code> clause that specifies what will
  be the aggregation function and what will be used as an input. The number 1 is the input - we ignore the 
  value that comes from the event stream and just add one every time. You could for example sum X-coordinates
  of the clicks, in which case you'd write <code>Sum(ea.X)</code>.</p>
<p>The call to the <code>Listen</code> method is similar as in C#. Lambda function in Visual Basic
  is written using <code>Function(..) ...</code> syntax. One of the limitations is that it can't contain
  assignment in the body, so that's why we implemented the <code>SetText</code> function first. Thanks to this,
  we can write a lambda function that contains method call, which is valid.</p>  
<p>All the examples that we've seen so far were quite interesting, but a little limited. The most important
  limitation is that once they started executing, the behavior didn't change. All of the examples were always
  doing the same thing.</p>

<h2>Changing behavior dynamically</h2>
<p>In this section we're going to look at another set of operators that I'll call <em>switching operators</em>.
  These operators can be used for writing programs that change their behavior during the execution and start
  reacting differently. For example, we'll extend our 'click counting' sample and add a checkbox that
  will specify whether we want to add 1 or subtract 1. Another example is that we could write a program that
  would start behaving differently after an event occurs ten times. These examples should give you an 
  idea what I mean by <em>dynamically</em>. When you write the program, you don't know when the 
  change in the behavior will happen, because it is controlled by the program execution. The operators that we'll 
  look at now are all very powerful, because most of the programs change parts of their behavior during the 
  execution.</p>

<h3>Choosing between behaviors</h3>
<p>The first example that we'll implement is the 'click counting' sample with 'decrement' checkbox.
  We'll add a checkbox to the form and we'll want to subtract 1 from the total every time the user clicks
  on a button while the checkbox is checked and add 1 in case the checkbox is not checked.
  Let's start by a thing that you already know. We'll use aggregation to create a stream that will 
  yield a value when user changes the checkbox state. The values in the stream will be 1 (when checkbox 
  is checked) or -1. We also don't want to wait until the user changes the state, so we'll add one 
  additional initial event that will be triggered shortly after the program starts using <code>Reactive.After</code>:
  </p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Triggered after 1 second and then on every check-box click
var eZigZag =
  Reactive.Merge
    (checkDecrement.AttachEvent("Click"), 
     Reactive.After(1000, EventArgs.Empty))
  // Create an event stream containing: 1, -1, 1, -1, ...  
  .Aggregate(-1, (current, _) =&gt; current * -1);
</pre>
<p>The input for the <code>Aggregate</code> operator will be <code>EventArgs</code> values from the events.
  This isn't needed and in cases like that, I'll often just use underscore as a variable name (in F#, this means
  ignore the value; in C#, it is a valid variable name, but it suggests that we don't care about it). 
  The initial value is -1 and every time an event occurs, we just multiply it by -1 to get a zig-zag stream 
  containing 1, -1, 1, -1 etc.</p>

<img src="/articles/reactive/csswitch.png" alt="Counting clicks with decrement checkbox" style="float:right; margin:15px;"/>
<p>Now comes the interesting part. We know how to count the number of clicks on a button and we have another
  event stream (<code>eZigZag</code>) that gives us a value every time we want to switch between addition
  and subtraction when processing button clicks. We can write this using <code>SwitchRepeatedly</code>,
  which calls our function every time the value in the zig-zag stream changes. The function that we 
  provide is the most important thing. Instead of returning some value, it will generate an event stream.
  The overall event stream will then switch between the event streams generated by our function.
  Let's take a look at the example and I'll explain everything in a more detail shortly:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Dynamically switch between 1, 1, 1... and -1, -1, -1...
eZigZag.SwitchRepeatedly(n =&gt;
     from ea in btnClick.AttachEvent("Click") select n)
     
  // Sum all nubers coming from the 'switch'
  .Sum().Listen(n =&gt; 
     lblOut.Text = String.Format("Current count is: {0}", n));
</pre>
<p>The input for the <code>SwitchRepeatedly</code> operator is the event that will be triggered
  when the application starts (with 1 as the argument) and then every time the 'decrement' checkbox
  is clicked. This means that the lambda function will be executed for the first time when
  the application starts. The code inside the lambda function creates another event stream.
  In our example, it attaches event handler for the <code>Click</code> event of the button and
  yields <code>n</code> every time the event occurs. This variable is an argument for the 
  lambda function and it will have value 1 at the beginning. Later (when <code>eZigZag</code> is 
  triggered), it will alternate between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>The overall type of the lambda function is <code>Func&lt;int,IEvent&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>.
  This means that it gets <code>int</code> as an argument and returns an event of integers.
  The result of <code>SwitchRepeatedly</code> is an event that does the same thing as the
  event returned by the lambda function (in our example, yields 1 every time button is clicked).
  However, when the <code>eZigZag</code> is triggered, it calls the function to get a new event
  stream and then starts to behave just like this new event stream. In our example, the event
  returned by the second call will be yielding -1 values. The <code>Repeatedly</code> in the
  name of the operator suggests that the behavior is changed dynamically every time an event
  in the source stream occurs is triggered. </p>  
<p>Also note that the type of <code>eZigZag</code> and the type of the event returned
  by the lambda function can be different. If the lambda function returned for example
  event yielding strings, the result will be also an event yielding strings. Values from 
  the source event are used only to generate the current event. The next switching
  operator will be a bit simpler, but (as we'll see shortly) very useful as well!</p>

<h3>Changing behavior on the first event</h3>
<p>In this section we'll take a look at <code>SwitchFirst</code> operator. It allows us
  to write a event streams that yield a value when the event occurs for the first time
  and then start behaving differently. For example, if you wanted to display a game 
  score, you'd start with 0 when the user clicks on 'Start' and then switch to the 
  actual algorithm that computes the score.</p>
<p>Our example will be simpler. When the user clicks on a button, we'll display a message
  that the button was clicked for the first time. Any subsequent click will display
  a message showing the number of clicks:</p>  

<pre lang="csharp">
btnClick.AttachEvent("Click").Select(_ =&gt; "Clicked for the first time!")
  .SwitchFirst(s =&gt;
    // Return the new behavior: Sum clicks &amp; return message
    btnClick.AttachEvent("Click").Select(_ =&gt; 1).Sum()
      .Select(n =&gt; string.Format("Clicked {0} times!", n)))
  .Listen(s =&gt; lblOut.Text = s);
</pre>
<p>The event that we use as a source for <code>SwitchFirst</code> yields a message when 
  a button is clicked. The <code>SwitchFirst</code> operator waits for this event and
  sends this event further to its listeners. This means that the <code>Listen</code>
  handler will receive the message as well. After triggering the event, <code>SwitchFirst</code>
  call the function used as an argument to get a new event stream and changes its behavior
  to do the same thing as this event stream. In our example, the function returns an
  event stream that counts the number of clicks. After the first click (and after showing
  the first message), the program will start counting the clicks and it will display
  the new count every time the button is clicked.</p>
<p>This operator can be used for changing the behavior once, but it is actually far more interesting.
  It can be used for changing the behavior in almost any way if we use it together with 
  recursion. We'll look at an example in the next section.</p>

<h3>Changing behavior on every event</h3>
<p>Recursion is a very useful technique and it is used very often in functional programming.
  In imperative languages, it is used less frequently, so if you're not used to it, you 
  may find this section a bit tricky. As we've seen, we can use <code>SwitchFirst</code> to 
  change the behavior after the first event occurs. This is done by specifying a function
  that will be called to get a new event stream.</p>
<p>However, the newly returned event stream can also contain <code>SwitchFirst</code>, so
  it can change the behavior again. Even more interestingly, we can generate the original 
  stream and the new one using the same function, so every event stream returned by the function
  will always wait for the first event and then switch to another behavior generated using
  the same function (possibly with some other arguments). </p>
<p>This sounds a bit abstract, so let me show you a practical example. We'll a similar 
  construct in the next article when developing the game. We want to implement the
  following behavior: When you click on the button a message "Click" will appear. 
  After 5 seconds, it will be replaced with "Timeout!" unless you clicked on the 
  button again during that time. The way we'll do this is that we'll wait for an event
  - either click or a timeout. After an event occurs we'll show the right message
  and then change the behavior to start from the beginning again. This change here is very 
  important, because it resets the timer, so the "Timeout!" message will not appear sooner
  than after next 5 seconds:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
// 'eClickOrTimeout' is a function that returns an evnet
Func&lt;IEvent&lt;string&gt;&gt; eClickOrTimeout = null;
eClickOrTimeout = () =&gt; 
  // Triggered when user clicks on the button or after 5 seconds
  Reactive.Merge
    (btnClick.AttachEvent("Click").Select(_ =&gt; "Click..."),
     Reactive.After(5000, "Timeout!"))
  .SwitchFirst(e =&gt; eClickOrTimeout());

// Create an event stream and add listener
eClickOrTimeout()
  .Listen(s =&gt; lblOut.Text = s);
</pre>
<p>We first declare a value called <code>eClickOrTimeout</code>. This is not an event as in
  previous examples, but a function that creates an event when we call it. This is because
  we need to generate a new event every time when the <code>SwitchFirst</code> operator
  calls our function to make sure that the event generated using <code>Reactive.After</code>
  will be triggered after 5 seconds (if it wasn't a function, the event would be triggered 
  only once). Because we need to use the <code>eClickOrTimeout</code> inside its own declaration
  we first initialize the value to <code>null</code> and then assign it the actual value.</p>
<p>When constructing the event, we attach a handler for the button click and merge it
  with an event generated using <code>Reactive.After</code>. This means that the first
  event will be either a mouse click or a timeout event after 5 seconds. This is followed
  by a <code>SwitchFirst</code> call. When the first event occurs, <code>SwitchFirst</code>
  will throw the original event stream away (which means that no further clicks or timeouts 
  will be handled) and changes its behavior to do the same thing as the new stream. 
  The new stream is generated using the given function. In our example, it recursively 
  uses <code>eClickOrTimeout</code>, so it will again wait either for a click or for a timeout.</p>  
<p>To add an event handler to this recursive stream, we run the lambda function to start 
  the event processing and add an event handler using <code>Listen</code> operator.
  As I mentioned earlier, writing recursion explicitly is often quite tricky, so 
  <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> provides one more switching operator that can be used for 
  implementing this example in an easier way. </p>

<h3>Using recursive switch operator</h3>
<p>The operator is named <code>SwitchRecursive</code> and it is the last one from the 
  family of switching operators that <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> currently implements.
  It allows us to write the previous example without using recursion explicitly (internally,
  it will do almost the same thing). The only difference is that we have to explicitly specify
  the first event that will trigger the whole processing. In the previous example, the
  first event was the same as all the subsequent events. In the new version, the program
  will first wait 1 second and then start the processing similarly as in the last example:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
Reactive.After(1000, "")
  .SwitchRecursive(s =&gt; 
      Reactive.Merge
        (btnClick.AttachEvent("Click").Select(_ =&gt; "Click..."),
         Reactive.After(5000, "Timeout!"))
  .Listen(s =&gt; lblOut.Text = s);
</pre>
<p>The <code>SwitchRecursive</code> operator waits for the first event from the input stream and
  then calls the function to generate the new event. So far, it does the same thing as
  <code>SwitchFirst</code>. However, the difference is that when a first event occurs in the
  returned event stream (in our example either a click or a timeout) it calls the function
  again to obtain a new stream again. When calling the function, it uses the value returned
  by the last event as an argument, so we can represent any state we need during the 
  event processing.</p>
<p>So far, we've looked at three slightly different switching operators that should be
  sufficient for most of the event processing that you may need. In the last section, we're
  going to look how they can be written using LINQ queries. This is not completely straightforward
  as for example when using <code>where</code>, but it still simplifies the code in many
  situations.</p>
  
<h2>Switches and LINQ queries</h2>
<p>From all the query operators that LINQ provides the one that corresponds closely to our 
  <em>switching operators</em> is <code>SelectMany</code> (side note for Haskell programmers:
  this is <code>bind</code>, but not all switching operators above have exactly the right type).
  When writing a query using the simplified syntax, <code>SelectMany</code> is used when you 
  have multiple <code>from</code> clauses in the query. </p>
<p>The following query implements the first example that we implemented earlier using
  <code>SwitchRepeatedly</code>. It counts number of clicks on a specified button and allows
  changing between incrementing and decrementing using a checkbox. We first declare an
  event that is triggered when the application starts and then when the user clicks on the
  'decrement' checkbox. This is just to make the code more readable - it would be perfectly
  possible to write the whole thing as a single query. Then we write a query with multiple
  <code>from</code> clauses that internally uses the <code>SwitchRepeatedly</code> operator.
  Let's take a look at the example and I'll explain how exactly the operator is used later:</p>
  
<pre lang="csharp">
// When application starts and then when 'decrement' checkbox is clicked
var eDecrementClick = Reactive.Merge
 (Reactive.After(1000, EventArgs.Empty), 
  checkDecrement.AttachEvent("Click"));

// Create stream with 1, -1, 1.. and combine it using 'SwitchRepeatedly'
(from n in eDecrementClick.Aggregate(1, (current, _) =&gt; current * -1)
 from m in btnClick.AttachEvent("Click").UseSwitchRepeatedly()
 select -1 * n).Sum().Listen(n =&gt; 
    lblOut.Text = String.Format("Current count is: {0}", n));
</pre>
<p>The first <code>from</code> clause specifies the input stream for the <code>SwitchRepeatedly</code>
  operator. The second one specifies how to obtain an event stream once we have a value for the
  <code>n</code> variable (or when we get a new value as a result of the first event being triggered).
  An interesting thing to note is that we use an extension method <code>UseSwitchRepeatedly</code>
  at the end of the second <code>from</code> clause. This alone doesn't do anything, but it 
  specifies what kind of switch do we want to use (similarly, you could write <code>UseSwitchFirst</code>
  or <code>UseSwitchRecursive</code>). If you forget to specify this, you'll get a compilation error,
  because the C# compiler will not know which of the possible <code>SelectMany</code> implementations
  should it use. There is one implementation for every switch and this <code>UseXyz</code> method specifies
  this by returning a special type of event. In our example, it will return <code>IEventSwitchRepeatedly&lt;T&gt;</code>
  instead of <code>IEvent&lt;T&gt;</code>, but this is very much just a technical detail
  that you don't have to worry about.</p>

<p>I believe that in some cases, the query syntax is more readable. In particular, it is interesting
  when you need to use other operations that are available in a query such as <code>select</code> or
  <code>where</code> or for example <code>Aggregate</code> in Visual Basic (actually, you could even use 
  nested <em>switching operators</em>). Anyway, the following example should give you an idea how 
  the query is translated to the ordinary method calls:</p>
<pre>
(from n in <span style="background-color:#b0c0ff">eDecrementClick.Aggregate(1, (current, _) =&gt; current * -1)</span>
 from m in <span style="background-color:#c0ffb0">btnClick.AttachEvent("Click")</span>.UseSwitchRepeatedly()
 select <span style="background-color:#ffb0c0">-1 * n</span>)
<span style="background-color:#ffff90"> .Sum().Listen(n =&gt; 
    lblOut.Text = String.Format("Current count is: {0}", n));</span>
</pre>
<p style="text-indent:0px">This code will be translated to something like this:</p>
<pre><span style="background-color:#b0c0ff">(...)</span>.SwitchRepeatedly(n =&gt; <span style="background-color:#c0ffb0">...</span>).Select(... =&gt; <span style="background-color:#ffb0c0">...</span>).<span style="background-color:#ffff90">(...)</span></pre>
<p>Actually, the query is compiled to a code that calls one of the <code>SelectMany</code> operators, but
  this is what we get if we look at the implementation of this operator. As I already mentioned, the use 
  of <code>SwitchRepeatedly</code> switching operator is controlled by the <code>UseXyz</code> method.
  The example uses <code>select</code> clause, which is automatically translated to a call to <code>Select</code>
  method that is added after the call to <code>SwitchRepeatedly</code>. If you included <code>where</code>
  clause, it would be added after the call to switch as well and these are the cases where query syntax
  is a lot more concise.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we've looked at a couple of operators that you can use in <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>.
  In particular, we discussed various ways of doing aggregation (such as <code>Sum</code>) and I also 
  explained how this is different to the usual notion of aggregation in LINQ that works with finite data
  sets. Next, we discussed three slightly different <em>switching operators</em>. These are very important
  when implementing a more sophisticated code and in the next article we're going to look at a larger 
  example that will use them (together with everything else that I just introduced). </p>
<p>I already mentioned in the previous article, that the current implementation is just a prototype
  that demonstrates the idea and shows what can be done with LINQ. My goal is to work on this project 
  and turn it into a more stable and easier to use library. Currently, you can run into a problem
  when using switching operators in some ways, because the resources used by events may not be
  released correctly. Also, I'm not yet sure which of the switching operators are really the most useful, so 
  if you'll play with the code, definitely send me your feedback!</p>
