    <h1>The Duality of Object and Event references</h1>
<p>Mathematical duality [<a href="#duallinks">2</a>] 
  is a very useful and elegant concept that gives us a nice way of speaking
  about objects or structures that behave in some way exactly conversely. There
  is no clear definition of what <em>duality</em> is. However, the idea is that when we
  have two structures that behave conversely and we know that something is true
  about the first one, then we get the opposite statement about the other structure
  "for free" (if you know how to translate from one structure to the other).</p>

<p>In this article, I'll talk about an interesting example of duality that (to my best
  knowledge) wasn't described by anyone before. The two dual structures are 
  <strong>references between objects</strong> in a normal program and <strong>references
  between events</strong> in a reactive application. The statement that is going to 
  become obvious thanks to the duality principle is describing which of the objects (or
  events) are garbage and can be safely collected by garbage collector.</p>

<p>This topic is in much more details 
  discussed in a paper [<a href="#duallinks">4</a>] I wrote with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/dsyme/">Don Syme</a> 
  and that I presented at the ISMM Workshop (see also <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/pldi-2010-trip.aspx">my
  trip report from PLDI</a>). In this article, I'll try to give an accessible
  description of the most interesting idea from the paper...</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This concept of duality is quite useful in programming. In functional programming, the
  <em>product type</em> (usually called tuple or record) is dual of <em>sum type</em>
  (called discriminated union in F#). Let me demonstrate this using a simple example.
  Here are two simple type declarations:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Color with R, G, B components   // Shape can be one of three types
type Color =                       type Shape = 
  { Red : int                        | Square of Point * int
    Green : int                      | Circle of Point * int
    Blue : int }                     | Triangle of Point * Point * Point
</pre>
<p>What is <em>dual</em> about these two types? When you have a record type consisting of three
  values (such as <code>Color</code>), you get three functions for extracting individual 
  values from the record (reading <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code> and <code>Blue</code>  
  component). On the other hand, when you have a discriminated union type, you get three
  functions for constructing <code>Shape</code> from the three possible cases (creating a 
  shape representing <code>Square</code>, <code>Circle</code> and <code>Triangle</code>). 
  When we draw this idea using a simple diagram, you can easily see what the 
  duality means:</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/event-object-duality/duality.png" />
</div>
  
<p>The two diagrams are essentially the same, with the only difference that the arrows in the
  diagrams are reversed! In fact, most of the dualities usually mean just this - when you
  find some nice way of drawing the concept as a diagram with arrows, the dual concept
  looks exactly the same, just with the arrows reversed.</p>

<p>Other interesting examples of duality in the programming languages world are for example   
  the duality between <code>IEnumerable</code> (representing pull-based sequence of
  values) and <code>IObservable</code> (representing push-based sequence of values) in .NET, which
  has been nicely described by Erik Meijer [<a href="#duallinks">1</a>]. There are also some nice 
  arrows involving <code>IObservable</code> in an article by Matthew Podwysocki [<a href="#duallinks">3</a>].
  The next example is <em>covariance</em> and <em>contravariance</em> of generic types,
  which is now available in C# 4.0. If you're wondering what arrows would be reversed 
  in this case, you would change the orientation of arrows representing the inheritance,
  but I'll write about this in some future article.</p>

<p>Now, let's look at the duality between <strong>object references</strong> and <strong>event
  references</strong> that I wanted to talk about in this article. I'll first describe the two
  (idealized) dual world - the World of Objects and the World of Events and then we'll look
  what does that tell us about garbage collection...</p>

<h2>World of Objects</h2>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/event-object-duality/objects.png" style="float:right;margin:10px;margin-left:20px;" />
<p>Let's start by looking at references between objects in the usual environment.
  The diagram on the right gives an example - we have a root object called <code>program</code>
  that references two other objects (<code>product</code> and <code>customer</code>). 
  The diagram also shows an object <code>order</code> which references <code>product</code>,
  but isn't referenced from any other object (we'll see that it can be garbage collected 
  later).
  </p>

<p>There are two important facts about the World of Objects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Roots can be called directly</strong> - The <em>root</em> object is the one
    that is called initially (there may be more of them, but that's not important). When the
    object is called, it can make calls to other (referenced) objects and transfer the control
    flow to them. </li>
  <li><strong>Any node can have visible effect</strong> - All of the objects in the 
    graph can "do something useful" such as print to the console, interact with the user
    or modify some state of the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two points describe essential information that is important for specifying
  what is a garbage. We don't want to dispose of any object that can do something useful.
  In this scenario, this means that we cannot collect <em>roots</em> (because they can
  be called from an external caller) and we cannot collect any object that is reachable
  from the roots (because the control flow may be transferred to it while the application
  is running). This leads to the usual definition of what is <em>garbage</em> in this 
  environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An object is <strong>reachable</strong> if there is a path to it from some <strong>root</strong>.</li>
  <li>An object that is not <strong>reachable</strong> is <strong>garbage</strong> and can be collected.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we'll see shortly, we can translate all of the points that I highlighted with bullets 
  to the World of Events. We just need to write a few things in exactly the opposite way.
  However, first I should talk a little bit about what I mean by the <em>World of Events</em>...</p>

<h2>World of Events</h2>
<p>When talking about <em>events</em>, you can imagine events as they are used in .NET and
  first-class events in F# [<a href="#duallinks">5</a>] (see also <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">my
  earlier article about them</a>). In general, an <em>event</em> is something that can 
  emit a value at any time. You can create derived events that listen to some other 
  events and emit the value that they receive only when it matches some predicate or 
  for example emit a value that is calculated based on the original value. Let's 
  demonstrate the idea using a simple snippet that uses first-class events in F#:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Creates an event that emits a value whenever one of 
// the two events (MouseDown of btnOne or btnTwo) emit 
let anyButton = 
  Event.merge btnOne.MouseDown btnTwo.MouseDown

// Creates an event that emits a string "click!"
// whenever user clicks on any button with left-click
let anyLeft = anyButton 
  |&gt; Event.filter (fun e -&gt; 
    e.Button = MouseButtons.Left)
  |&gt; Event.map (fun _ -&gt; "click!")
</pre>
<p>These two examples are pretty simple, but they should illustrate the point.
  You can write pretty complicated event processing code just by creating and 
  composing events. So, let's now imagine that we have an environment that contains
  <em>only events</em>. What would this kind of world look like?</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/event-object-duality/events.png" style="float:right;margin:10px;margin-left:20px;" />
<p>The diagram on the right shows a simple scenario from the World of Events. 
  Let's start from the <code>click</code> event. When it emits a value, the value
  will be forwarded to the <code>right click</code> event (which emits the value only
  when it was caused by right mouse button). The value is also forwarded to an event
  called <code>handler</code> - we'll talk about this event shortly. The next branch
  contains <code>key press</code> event which also sends values to <code>handler</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>handler</code> event is a special event that can also have observable 
  effects. When it receives a value from other events (or from the "outside"), it can 
  for example modify something in the user interface or print to the console. In the terminology
  used in .NET, those events actually represent <em>event handlers</em> that can be 
  attached to events, but we can easily model them as special types of events.</p>

<p>Let's summarize the interesting aspects of the World of Events (you may want to 
  compare the points with those that I wrote about the World of Objects):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Any event can emit</strong> - In general, we assume that any
    events can emit value whenever it wants (for example, when the user does something). 
    This is caused by some "external" source that we don't analyze. However an event
    can also send values to other events (by following the references in the diagram).</li>
  <li><strong>Only leaves can have visible effect</strong> - Only some of the 
    events can perform something else than just emit a value. We call these special
    events <em>leaves</em> (and they are displayed in green).</li>
</ul>

<p>Just like when discussing the World of Objects, these two points tell us which 
  of the events are garbage. In general, we can dispose of any events that cannot
  cause an observable action. An observable action can be caused only by special 
  <em>leaf</em> events (drawn in the green color). However, these events can be triggered
  by other events that have a reference to them (e.g. in the above example, the event
  <code>click</code> can trigger the event <code>handler</code>). Now, we can 
  easily define what is a garbage when it comes to events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An event is <strong>observable</strong> if there is a path from it to some <strong>leaf</strong>.</li>
  <li>An event that is not <strong>observable</strong> is <strong>garbage</strong> and can be collected.</li>
</ul>

<p>These definitions are <em>dual</em> to the two points that we've seen 
  earlier when discussing the World of Objects. In the next section, we'll compare
  the two in more detail and I'll explain the duality between them.</p>

<h2>Garbage Collection and Duality</h2>
<p>As I wrote in the introduction, <em>duality</em> usually means that two structures
  are the same, with the only difference that some arrows are reversed. This is exactly
  the case of <em>garbage</em> in the World of Objects and World of Events.
  In both of the cases, we draw objects (or events) as nodes and references as 
  oriented links between them. When we want to find objects (or events) that are garbage,
  we need to check the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An object is garbage if there is no path <strong>to</strong> it <strong>from</strong> some root.</li>
  <li>An event is garbage if there is no path <strong>from</strong> it <strong>to</strong> some leaf.</li>
</ul>

<p>I highlighted the words <strong>from</strong> and <strong>to</strong>, so that you can 
  easily see that they are swapped. Let's now look at the two diagrams that I used
  earlier in the discussion. The following version also shows which of the objects (events)
  are garbage and can be safely collected:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/event-object-duality/objects-gc.png" style="margin-right:40px" />
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/event-object-duality/events-gc.png" />
</div>
<p>In this case, the duality between the two structures tells us how to implement
  garbage collection for the idealized World of Events. Instead of looking for objects
  that are not referenced from roots, we need to look for the <em>dual</em> of this 
  description - events that do not reference any leaves.</p>
<p>We can also use duality in a different way. Let's say that we already have a standard garbage 
  collection algorithm for objects and some graph of references between events. Now, we can
  collect events that are garbage using the algorithm for garbage collection in the non-reversed
  scenario. We just need to reverse all the links in the graph and then run the garbage collection
  algorithm for objects. The nodes that will be marked as garbage will be those that 
  are garbage when talking about events. You can look at the two above diagrams and easily
  see that this trick would work!</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The main point of this article was to demonstrate an elegant concept of duality 
  that comes from mathematics and to show that it can be used when thinking about 
  garbage collection in two dual worlds - the World of Objects and an idealized World
  of Events. If you want to read more about this topic, you can also read our 
  paper [<a href="#duallinks">4</a>], which also describes why this is an important problem
  when it comes to first-class events in F# and how to integrate the two worlds - if you
  wanted to model for example .NET application which contains both objects and events.</p>

<p>How can the ideas from this article be useful in practice? First of all, duality
  gives us a nice way of understanding the problem. When we know that something works in 
  case of object references, we can easily find something that works for event references
  (just by replacing <strong>from</strong> with <strong>to</strong> and the other way 
  round in the description). However, to take the idea further, I believe that a framework for
  reactive programming based on events could use the <em>dual garbage collection</em>
  described in this article to collect unused events...</p>
