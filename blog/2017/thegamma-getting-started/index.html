        <h1>Getting started with The Gamma just got easier</h1>
<p>Over the last year, I have been working on <a href="http://thegamma.net/">The Gamma project</a>, which aims
to make data-driven visualizations more trustworthy and to enable large number of people to
build visualizations backed by data. The Gamma makes it possible to create visualizations that
are built on trustworthy primary data sources such as the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org">World Bank</a>
and you can provide your own <a href="http://thegamma.net/publishing/">data source by writing a REST service</a>.</p>
<p>A great piece of feedback that I got when talking about The Gamma is that this is a nice ultimate
goal, but it makes it hard for people to start with The Gamma. If you do not want to use the World
Bank data and you're not a developer to write your own REST service, how do you get started?</p>
<a href="https://gallery.thegamma.net/create">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/thegamma-getting-started/gallery.png" style="margin:10px 10% 20px 10%; width:80%"/>
</a>
<p>To make starting with The Gamma easier, the gallery now has a <a href="https://gallery.thegamma.net/create">new four-step getting started page</a>
where you can upload your data as a CSV file or paste it from Excel spreadsheet and create nice
visualizations that let your reader explore other aspects of the data.</p>
<p><a href="https://gallery.thegamma.net/create">Head over to The Gamma Gallery to check it out</a> or continue
reading to learn more about creating your first The Gamma visualization...</p>
<h2>Creating interactive visualization step by step</h2>
<p>The four-step walkthrough for creating your own data visualizations contains a number of useful
hints in the side panel, so if you read those, you should be able to get what you need. To give
a concrete example, let's look at one example problem!</p>
<h3>Step #1: Uploading your data</h3>
<p>In the first step, you have a number of options - you can choose one of the existing samples,
or you can skip directly to the editor (if you know what you want to do). However, the nice new
feature is that you can also upload a CSV file or paste CSV data. Here, I'm going to use a
<a href="https://github.com/the-gamma/workyard/blob/master/turing/people.csv">list of Turing Institute people</a>
that I scraped from the web site.</p>
<h3>Step #2: Writing data transformations</h3>
<p>When you upload data, the tool will create minimal data transformation that just gets the raw
data table. Here, you can experiment with the data transformations - type <code>.</code> after <code>uploaded</code>
to see what transformations are available!</p>
<a href="step2.png"><img src="step2.png" style="margin:10px 5% 20px 5%; width:90%"/></a>
<p>As you write the script, the tool will check your code in the background and the green
message indicates what data you got:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you finish with <code>get the data</code>, you will see a table icon, which means that we can create
table with your data because it has more than two columns.
</li>
<li>
If you end with <code>get series</code> like above, you will see a column chart icon - this happens when
your key is a string and the series can be visualized as a column or bar chart.
</li>
<li>
If you end with <code>get series</code> and your key is numerical, you will see a line chart, because
your data can be visualized as a scatter plot or line chart.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step #3: Creating (interactive) visualizations</h3>
<p>Once you create data transformation, the tool takes you to a next step, which is to create a
data visualization. Using the code from the previous step, it generates a minimal working
visualization.</p>
<a href="step3.png"><img src="step3.png" style="margin:10px 5% 20px 5%; width:90%"/></a>
<p>There are a number of options you can try here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you end up with <code>table.create</code>, table is probably the best we can do, but 
you can also adapt the code and use <code>get series</code> to obtain data in a format that
works for column, bar or even line charts.
</li>
<li>
The <code>chart.line</code> and <code>chart.bar</code> charts work fine most of the time, but we've been
working on replacing them with slightly more flexible charts that are available
under <code>compost.charts</code>, so try using those instead as in the screenshot above!
</li>
<li>
More interestingly, you can also use <code>youguess</code> to create <a href="http://nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/15/us/politics/you-draw-obama-legacy.html">New York Times 
inspired</a>
charts where the reader has to make a guess before seeing the results. This works for
<a href="https://gallery.thegamma.net/48/you-draw-it-united-kingdom-co2-emissions-with-axis-labels">lines</a>,
<a href="https://gallery.thegamma.net/29/you-guess-population-of-top-6-countries-of-the-world">columns</a> and
a few other kinds of charts.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step #4: Provide details and share the chart</h3>
<p>The last page of the process asks you for more information about the snippet and the data
source. We are not using the data source information yet, but this will eventually be
visible to people who explore snippets and want to find out where the data comes from,
so you can use this to clarify the data source.</p>
<p>Once you upload the snippet, it gets posted to The Gamma gallery that you can link to, but
more importantly, it also makes it very easy to embed the snippet into your web page. If
you go to the "Embed the snippet" tab, you can get short embeddable HTML code snippet
that includes the source code of your visualization.</p>
<a href="step4.png"><img src="step4.png" style="margin:10px 5% 20px 5%; width:90%"/></a>
<h2>Embedding the visualization</h2>
<p>In the above example, I replaced the bar chart created using <code>compost.charts.bar</code>
with an interactive <code>youguess.columns</code> chart and created a snippet where you can
<a href="https://gallery.thegamma.net/34/guess-the-number-of-turing-people-3">guess the number of people at the Alan Turing Institute</a>
based on the university with which they are affiliated. If you embed this into your
blog, you will get the following result!</p>
<div style="padding:0px 40px 0px 10px">
<script type="text/thegamma" id="s34-code">let data =
  shared.'by date'.'May 2017'.'The Alan Turing Institute People (May 2017, corrected)'
    .'filter data'.'University is not'.'The Alan Turing Institute'.then
    .'group data'.'by University'.'count all'.then
    .'get series'.'with key University'.'and value count'
youguess.columns(data)
</script>
<div class="thegamma" id="s34"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
if (!thegamma) { var thegamma=[],tg="https://thegamma.net/lib/thegamma-0.1/";
["//www.google.com/jsapi",tg+"babel.min.js",tg+"core-js.min.js",tg+"require.js",tg+"embed.js"].
 forEach(function(u) { document.write('<sc'+'ript type="text/javascript" src="'+u+'"></sc'+'ript>'); }); 
} thegamma.push("s34");
</script>
</div>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>If you are interested in creating more transparent data-driven visualizations that let the reader
explore data further on their own, then The Gamma is here for you! The Gamma Gallery now makes
it even easier to get started - in just four steps, you can upload your data from CSV files or
Excel spreadsheets, transform them and create (potentially interactive) visualization that is
easy to embed into any web page!</p>
<p>If you have been curious about The Gamma, but never quite looked at it because it was hard to
to get started, now is your time. For more information:</p>
