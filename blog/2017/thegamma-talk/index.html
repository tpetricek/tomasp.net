        <h1><span class="hm">Towards open and transparent data-driven storytelling</span><span class="hs"> Notes from my Alan Turing Institute talk</span></h1>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/">an earlier blog post</a>, I've been
spending some time at the <a href="http://turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> recently working on <a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma
project</a>. The goal is to make data visualizations on the web more transparent.
When you see a visualization online, you should be able to see where the data comes from, how it has been
transformed and check that it is not misleading, but you should also be able to modify it and
visualize other aspects of the data that interest you.</p>
<p>I gave a talk about my work as part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcr5vuAH5TPlYox-QLj4ySw/videos">talk series at The Alan Turing Institute</a>, which has
been recorded and is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjgpmzFjOA">now available on YouTube</a>. If you prefer to watch talks, this is a good
45 minute overview of what I've been working on with great video quality (the video switches from
camera view to screen capture for demos!)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px">

</a>
</div>
<p>If you prefer text or do not have 45 minutes to watch the talk (right now), I wrote a short
summary that highlights the most important ideas from the talk. You can also check out the
<a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/Talks/2016/open-storytelling/">talk slides</a>, although I'll include
the most important ones here.</p>
<h2>Why open data-driven storytelling matters</h2>
<p>When I first started <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/thegamma/">thinking about this topic</a> back in
2015, I found it quite hard to convince people that working on tooling for transparent way of
telling stories with data is something important. Sadly, times have changed and the recent
events in the world gave me a completely new way to talk about the project...</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px">
<img src="slide1.jpg" style="max-width:80%"/>
</div>
<p>The term <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37995600">post-fact has been chosen as the word of 2016</a>
and there are rumors that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/19/crisis-of-statistics-big-data-democracy">statistics is becoming less relevant</a>
in public discourse. The term post-fact does not mean that more space is given to messages that are
not true. It means that it does not matter whether a message is true or not - and this is also fits
with the disinterest in statistics (and expert opinions).</p>
<p>Facebook and social networks often get blamed for helping to create echo chambers and social
bubbles (which they probably did), but I think that is only a part of the story. Facebook makes
it really easy to share your opinions and engage with others.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px">
<img src="slide2.jpg" style="max-width:80%"/>
</div>
<p>I believe that a part of the reason why facts are becoming less relevant is that working with facts
is very hard and a bit dull. If you want to share an opinion on Facebook, you get a plenty of tools
to make it more fun. What if you want to share a story or an observation supported by data from
a trustworthy data source? It will be really hard and, in the end, you'll just end up posting a
chart as an image that nobody can verify and further interact with.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea that everyone will get excited about facts backed by data is idealistic, but
you can use data to tell interesting stories that you would not be able to tell without data.
If they are interesting enough, then people will want to read them. A nice recent example is the
<a href="www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/08/sports/olympics/history-olympic-dominance-charts.html">Visual history of which countries dominated the summer
Olympics</a>
by New York Times.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px">
<img src="slide3.jpg" style="max-width:80%"/>
</div>
<p>The Olympic history visualization would not be possible without data, but it tells an interesting
story. Just by looking at the visualization, you can see the two world wars as well as the cold war
(American boycott of games in Soviet Union followed by Eastern Bloc boycott of the games in USA).</p>
<p>The visualization also makes you think about a number of other interesting questions. For example,
what would the chart look like for selected countries that you're particularly interested in?
Sadly, reproducing a data visualization project like this is very hard, even if the original
publisher releases a lot of the code and data. However, being able to see how the visualization
has been created and reproduce it is important for a number of reasons.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px">
<img src="slide4.jpg" style="max-width:80%"/>
</div>
<p>Letting people modify the visualization to answer their own questions, and perhaps even share
their results, is one reason why the open nature is important. Now, I do not expect everyone
to do this, but I think the few who will can help recover some of the trust in facts.</p>
<p>However, open data visualizations also need to be reproducible and invite the reader to check
that data is not used in misleading ways. A good example of the need for reproducibility is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt">Growth in a Time of Debt</a> paper, which
inspired many economic policies during the 2008 crisis and turned out to be hard to reproduce
and likely contained mistakes.</p>
<p>Being able to understand how exactly has data been transformed is equally interesting. For
example, in the Olympic games visualization, you can treat team sports as a single medal or
as individual medals. This skews the results quite a bit, because you award 8 medals for
rowing and even more for football instead of one. The reader should be able to understand this
and change it if they want to see the other view!</p>
<h2>Towards open data-driven storytelling with The Gamma</h2>
<p>Addressing the issues above is what I'm trying to do with <a href="https://thegamma.net">The Gamma project</a>.
You can find more information about the project in an <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/">article I wrote earlier</a>
and on the <a href="https://thegamma.net">project homepage</a>. The Gamma tries to make producing transparent
and open data visualizations easier by giving you a simple web-based scripting language where you
can integrate external data (using type providers), aggregate it and easily link it to a chart.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px">
<img src="slide5.jpg" style="max-width:80%"/>
</div>
<p>The key idea here is that there should be a script behind every visualization or every other use
of data in an article. A chart embedded as an image is just an image - you may trust that it has
been produced correctly or you may not, but unless you recreate the entire analysis on your own,
you cannot do anything else. Treating article as a program gives you a completely different
perspective.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px">
<img src="slide6.jpg" style="max-width:80%"/>
</div>
<p>When you visit an open data-driven article as a reader, you will first see the original version
of the article as produced by the author. However, the work on programming languages and tools
gives us an enormous number of tools that we can use on data-driven articles once we start seeing
them (or their backing representation) as programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can use provenance tracking methods to understand where data is coming from. For example,
is the conclusion based on generally trustworthy data sources such as the ones available
through the <a href="https://data.gov.uk/">Open Government Data</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use other program analysis methods to look for potential errors or misleading
calculations. Is the visualization extrapolating from too few data points? Is it adding
numbers with wrong units?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can provide additional context. A number telling you that GDP per capita in the UK is
$41,787 does not tell you much. If we know where the number comes from, the article can
automatically generate comparison with previous years and similar countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can automatically generate user interface that lets the reader change some of the
parameters of the visualization without even looking at the code. For example, see some
of the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-olympic-medalists/">examples from my Olympic data visualization</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, thinking about article as a program is a powerful paradigm that can generate a
number of ideas for tools that help make data visualization easier to understand, less misleading
and more fun.</p>
<p>Implementing all of these is a lot of work, so I started with a couple of them. To make the
early version of The Gamma as easy to use as possible, it is available as a standard JavaScript
component (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/thegamma-script">thegamma-script</a> on npm), which you
can easily embed into your web pages. The project is licensed under the MIT license and is
<a href="https://github.com/the-gamma">hosted on GitHub</a>. See <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2017/thegamma-package/">my previous blog post</a>
for more information about the package.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px">
<img src="slide7.jpg" style="max-width:80%"/>
</div>
<p>If you are interested in using the JavaScript component, check out the <a href="http://thegamma.net/developers/">documentation for
developers</a>. The most interesting aspect is that you can
easily provide your own data sources for the component, simply by implementing a REST service
that handles querying of the data. This is documented in the <a href="http://thegamma.net/publishing/">providing data</a>
section of the documentation.</p>
<p>In summary, I do not think that programming tools alone can recover faith in statistics and help
tackle the problem of post-truth politics or fake news. There is a lot more that needs to be done.
However, if you are a developer building data visualizations, then I think your work can
contribute - open and transparent data visualizations matter not just because they can be checked
and reproduce, but more importantly because they encourage a new way of thinking. Rather than
creating opaque reports that only experts can produce, we need to turn data science into
something that everyone can engage with!</p>
