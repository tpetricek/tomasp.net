        <h1>Accelerator and F# (I.): Introduction and calculating PI</h1>
<img src="/articles/accelerator-intro/montecarlo.png" alt="Calculating Pi using Monte-Carlo" style="float:left; margin:10px" />
<p>I already wrote about two projects that I worked on during an internship at
  MSR back in 2007 (<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/aspnet-in-fsharp.aspx" type="external">ASP.NET support in F#</a> and
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebtools-intro.aspx" type="external">F# WebTools</a>).
  Even though this was more than 2 years ago (and I did one more internship at MSR in the meantime),
  I still have one more project that I never published on the web. The folks from the F# team
  reminded me of this project recently, so I thought I could finally publish it. The project 
  used Microsoft Research Accelerator [<a href="#accelfsh1links">1</a>, <a href="#accelfsh1links">2</a>], 
  which is a C# library for developing array-based computations and executing them on a GPU. 
  More recently, the Accelerator team at MSR published Accelerator v2 [<a href="#accelfsh1links">3</a>],
  which was a good motivation to update my original project...</p>
  
<p>In this article, we'll look at the simplest way of using Accelerator from F#. Accelerator
  provides a managed interface that can be naturally used from both C# and F#. We can use
  a mix of method calls and overloaded operators to describe a computation. In F#, we'll also 
  define our additional custom operators to make the code a bit nicer. After we introduce
  Accelerator using a simple C# demo, we'll look how to calculate an approximate value of
  the PI number using a Monte-Carlo method.</p>
<p>This article is the first one from a series about using Accelerator from F#. The list
  of articles may change, but here is a list of articles that I'm currently planning to write:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accelerator and F# (I.): Introduction and calculating PI</strong></li>
  <li><a href="/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">Accelerator and F# (II.): The Game of Life on GPU</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx">Accelerator and F# (III.): Data-parallel programs using F# quotations</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx">Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations</a></li></ul>  

<h2>Introducing Accelerator</h2>  
<p>Accelerator v2 is implemented in native code, but ships with a managed wrapper that 
  allows us to use it elegantly from C# and other managed languages as well. The library
  exposes various types that can be used for creating data-parallel computations that 
  process 1D or 2D arrays of data. In this article, we'll work with <code>FloatParallelArray</code>,
  which represents a computation that returns a 1D array of floats (<code>float[]</code> in C#).</p>
<p>Accelerator provides overloaded operators for point-wise operations with arrays,
  so you can for example write <code>res = nums1 * nums2</code> which represents a point-wise
  multiplication of two arrays (<code>res[i] = nums1[i] * nums2[i]</code> for each <code>i</code>). 
  Aside from overloaded operators, we can use other operations with arrays that are available
  as static methods in the <code>ParallelArrays</code> class. For example the <code>Shift</code>
  method moves elements of the array to the left or to the right. Shifting elements of an array
  <code>[1; 2; 3; 4]</code> to the right by 1 will result in <code>[1; 1; 2; 3]</code> (the first
  element is left unchanged).</p>
<p>When writing code that calculates with the <code>FloatParallelArray</code> type, it is 
  important to realize, that we're not actually running any computations yet! The type 
  <em>represents</em> a computation and doesn't perform it. This means that when you write
  a computation that adds some arrays and performs a few other operations, Accelerator only
  remembers what do you want to do with the data. The computation is executed later
  when we create a <em>target</em> that knows how to perform the operations. If you're 
  familiar with LINQ to SQL, you already know this idea - writing calculation with the
  <code>FloatParallelArray</code> type is just like writing a LINQ query. Executing the
  computation later corresponds to running the LINQ query as a SQL code. The two 
  available targets allow us to run the code on a multi-core CPU (only on 64bit) and on 
  a GPU using DirectX 9 (in this case, the code is translated to shader code).</p>

<p>Enough with theory for now and let's look at some actual example. I'll start with a very 
  brief code that shows how to use Accelerator in C# and then we'll look at some more interesting
  F# code. Assume we have an array of <code>float</code> values named <code>nums</code>. 
  The following example builds a computation that calculates an average value of an element 
  and two its neighbors for each element in the array:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var input = new FloatParallelArray(nums);
var sum = 
  ParallelArrays.Shift(input, 1) + input + 
  ParallelArrays.Shift(input, -1);
var output = sum / 3.0f;
</pre>
<p>We start by creating a new <code>FloatParallelArray</code> instance that stores the
  input data for the program (this represents a constant computation). Then we write a 
  calculation that adds three arrays - the input array and the input array shifted 
  by 1 both to the left and to the right. Finally, on the last line, we divide the 
  array by 3. This is also a point-wise operation, so it actually divides each element
  of the array by 3. Now that we have a <code>FloatParallelArray</code> named <code>output</code>,
  which represents the computation, we can run it using GPU:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var target = new DX9Target();
var res = target.ToArray1D(output);
</pre>
<p>The code to run the computation is quite simple. We first initialize a <em>target</em>.
  We're using <code>DX9Target</code>, which executes computations using GPU. If we wanted
  to run the operation using multi-core CPU, we could use <code>X64MulticoreTarget</code>
  (but note that this works only on x64). If you run the code, you'll get results like this:</p>
<pre>
7, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1, 0, 7, 6, 5
6, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5
</pre>
<p>If you know a little bit about F#, you probably wouldn't have any troubles 
  using Accelerator from F#. Since F# is a fully-compatible managed language, 
  we can use any .NET libraries in a very similar way as in C#. However, we 
  can use a couple of tricks to make the F# code nicer and more readable than the 
  corresponding C# version...</p>

<h2>Calculating PI in F#</h2>
<p>Before we look at the calculation itself, we'll write a few lines of code
  that will make the rest of program nicer. This will be shared with the
  upcoming articles in the series and in principle, we could encapsulate
  the functionality in an F# library. However, I'll make the code as simple
  as possible and just write it again in each project.</p>

<h3>Using Accelerator from F#</h3>
<p>First of all, we'll need to add reference to the <code>Microsoft.Accelerator.dll</code>
  assembly. This is just a managed wrapper for a native library that also needs to 
  be copied to the output directory. You'll need to find an appropriate version of
  native <code>Accelerator.dll</code> in the Accelerator installation directory 
  (either x86 or x64 version) and copy it to <code>bin/Debug</code> in your project.
  Then we can start by writing a couple of helpers:
</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
open Microsoft.ParallelArrays

type PA = Microsoft.ParallelArrays.ParallelArrays
type FPA = Microsoft.ParallelArrays.FloatParallelArray

// Initialization of constant 2D arrays
let gridSize = 4096
let shape = [| gridSize; gridSize; |]
let zero, one = new FPA(0.0f, shape), new FPA(1.0f, shape)
</pre>
<p>We start by opening the namespace that contains all the Accelerator functionality.
  To make the code a little bit more succinct, we also define two type aliases. The
  <code>FPA</code> type represents a computation that returns an array of floats when
  executed. The <code>PA</code> type represents the static class which contains 
  operations for working with these computations.</p>
<p>Next, we specify the size of the array we'll use during the computation - we'll
  work with 2D arrays of the size 4096x4096. Under the cover, this will be used
  as a size of a texture on the GPU that's used to perform the computation using
  shaders. Even though we could work with one-dimensional arrays as well, using
  2D arrays is a good idea, because it can be easier processed on the GPU.</p>  
<p>We'll also create two simple <code>FPA</code> instances that represent 
  constant computations. The first one contains zeros and the second one contains
  ones. The second parameter of the constructor specifies the size of the array
  we're creating (using an array of integers with two elements). Since many of the
  operations that Accelerator can perform are point-wise, we'll need the two
  constants (<code>zero</code> and <code>one</code>) when encoding the algorithm.</p>
<p>As the last thing before looking at the actual computation, we'll also write
  three functions that wrap functionality that's available using static methods 
  in C# (we could of course use static methods directly, but using functions 
  will lead to a more idiomatic F# code):</p>  
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Calculating with 2D float arrays 
let sqrt (a:FPA) = PA.Sqrt(a)
let sum (a:FPA) = PA.Sum(a)
let select (cond:FPA) (a:FPA) (b:FPA) = PA.Select(cond,a,b)
</pre>
<p>The <code>sqrt</code> function is a point-wise operation that calculates
  square roots of all elements of the array. <code>sum</code> is a little bit more
  interesting - it adds all numbers from the source array and returns an array that
  contains just a single element, which is the sum (for example sum of <code>[1; 2; 3; 4]</code>
  will be an array <code>[10]</code>).</p>
<p>The most interesting operation is probably the <code>select</code> function.
  Just like others, it is a point-wise operation. It takes three arrays of floats 
  and expects arrays of the same size. It compares the value of the first array (<code>cond</code>)
  with zero. If the value is greater than or equal to zero, it returns a value from 
  the first array (<code>a</code>), otherwise it returns value from <code>b</code>
  For a one-dimensional array, this corresponds to the following C# code:
  <code>res[i] = cond[i]&gt;=0 ? a[i] : b[i]</code> (for each index <code>i</code>).
  Now, let's finally move on to the PI number calculation...</p>

<h3>Calculating PI using Monte Carlo</h3>
<p>We'll implement the PI calculation using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" type="external">Monte 
  Carlo</a> method. The idea of the algorithm is that we'll generate a large number of 
  random points in a square and then count how many of them are inside a circle inscribed
  in the square. You can get a better idea by looking at the image at the beginning
  of the article - the image shows a circle inside a window and a large number of 
  randomly generated points. Points inside the circle are in green and other points
  are in red. We'll need to count the fraction of points that are inside the circle.</p>
<p>To start, we'll need to generate a large number of random points. We'll generate 
  two 2D arrays with random values to represent X and Y coordinates of points. This can 
  be done using <code>Array2D.init</code> function, which initializes an array 
  using the function that calculates an element value (in our example, the function
  is called <code>generator</code>):</p>  
<pre lang="fsharp">
let rnd = new Random()
let generator x y = float32(rnd.NextDouble())

let px = new FPA(Array2D.init gridSize gridSize generator)
let py = new FPA(Array2D.init gridSize gridSize generator)
</pre>
<p>Once we have .NET arrays with random values, we use them to create
  constant computations represented as the <code>FloatParallelArray</code> type
  from Accelerator. Next, we'll write a function that takes a <em>target</em>
  (an object that knows how to evaluate <code>FloatParallelArray</code> computations)
  and calculates an approximate value of PI using our random points:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
let calculatePi (target:Target) =
  // Calculate distances of points from the center
  let pxc, pyc = (px - 0.5f) * 2.0f, (py - 0.5f) * 2.0f
  let distances = sqrt ((pxc * pxc) + (pyc * pyc))

  // Count points with distance less than one
  let inCircle = select (one - distances) one zero
  let count = sum(inCircle)

  // Evaluate the count and calculate PI
  let result = target.ToArray1D(count)
  result.[0] / (float32(gridSize * gridSize) / 4.0f)
</pre>

<p>The first two blocks of code work with the <code>FPA</code> type, which
  means that we're just composing a computation, which we'll execute later.
  We start by adjusting the random values a little bit. The numbers are
  in range 0 to +1, so we subtract 0.5 and multiply the values by 2, to get
  arrays with values in range -1 to +1. Next, we create a new array that
  represents distances of points from the point (0, 0). Note that each 
  <code>i, j</code> coordinate in the 2D array represents a single point.</p>

<p>Once we have the <code>distances</code> value, we want to count the 
  number of points that are inside the circle - this means points with
  distance less than or equal to 1. This can be implemented using a trick.
  We subtract <code>distances</code> from <code>one</code> and get an array
  with value larger than or equal to 0 when the point is inside the circle.  
  Then we use the <code>select</code> function to get 1 for points inside
  the circle and 0 for all other points (as a reminder - this use of
  the  <code>select</code> function corresponds to the following C# code:
  <code>(one - distances)[i] >= 0 ? one[i] : zero[i]</code>). If we
  then sum all values inside the 2D array, we'll get the count of points
  for which the result was 1 (meaning points inside the circle).</p>  

<p>As the last step, we need to calculate PI from the number of points
  inside the circle and the total number of points inside the square. The result
  of summing is stored in an array, because Accelerator works with arrays.
  However, it contains only one element, so we get the value using <code>result.[0]</code>.
  Then we divide it by the total number of points and also by 4, because our 
  square was of size 2 by 2 (values ranging from -1 to +1). And that's our
  value of PI! The last step is to actually run the computation using
  Accelerator:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
let dxTarget = new DX9Target()
let pi = calculatePi(dxTarget)  
printfn "Approximate PI value: %f" pi
</pre>

<p>As you can see, running the calculation is now pretty simple. We created an
  instance of <code>DX9Target</code> to run the computation on GPU and passed it 
  to our function that does all the work. Alternatively, we could also use <code>X64MulticoreTarget</code>
  to run the computation in parallel on a multi-core CPU.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article was a brief introduction of a very interesting Accelerator library
  and a demonstration of using this library from F# in the simples possible way.
  We've seen how to use the <code>FloatParallelArray</code>, which is a core type 
  representing a computation in Accelerator and we've implemented a PI calculation
  using it. In the next article of this series we'll look at one more example - a 
  famous Conway's Game of Life. Later, we'll also look how to run "usual" F# code
  (meaning, code that doesn't use <code>FloatParallelArray</code> explicitly) with
  Accelerator using F# quotations.</p>
