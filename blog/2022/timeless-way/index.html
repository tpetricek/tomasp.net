<p style="max-width:260px"><b>Figure 1.</b> The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander</p>
</div>
<p>Many programmers know the name of the architect Christopher Alexander for his work on
<em>design patterns</em> that has been adapted into the world of programming. A lot of people
know of the, sometimes ridiculed, patterns like strategy (functions!) or visitor (pattern
matching!) and some have read the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Cd7sBv" title="Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software - Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides">Gang of Four design patterns book</a> that introduced them.
A few people know of the <a href="https://dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf" title="Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community - Richard P. Gabriel">Patterns of Software</a> book by Richard P. Gabriel, which is a much more
profound reflection on software inspired by the work of Christopher Alexander. And almost
nobody has actually read Christopher Alexander's books. (Thanks in advance for reminding me
on <a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">Twitter</a> that I am mistaken...)</p>
<p>I read Alexander's <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2" title="Notes on the Synthesis of Form - Christopher Alexander">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a> a couple of years ago, and used
it as one of the sources for ideas in my recent Onward! essay on <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/" title="Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning - Tomas Petricek">architecture, design and urban
planning</a>, but I did not know his other work. Only recently, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/29/christopher-alexander-obituary">Christopher Alexander
died</a>,
I finally ordered two books that are most directly about design patterns,
<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">The Timeless Way of Building</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3wecpGG" title="A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction - Christopher Alexander">A Pattern Language</a>.</p>
<p>This post is a somewhat unorganized collection of thoughts triggered by reading of The Timeless
Way of Building, including my understanding of Alexander's work, some critical thoughts
and on the applications of his ideas to software.</p>
<h2>Making sense of Alexander</h2>
<p>Reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2" title="Notes on the Synthesis of Form - Christopher Alexander">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a> left me confused. The first half of the book
is a nice analysis of how traditional architecture produces forms that perfectly fit the
environment and optimally solve the problems they need to solve. New England farmhouses or
Musgum mud huts have been adapted over generations. They keep the same basic structure, but
are easy to adapt to specific local needs. In contrast, modern architecture reinvents the form
each time, which makes it hard to account for all possible needs. This is an interesting point
and it <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/" title="Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning - Tomas Petricek">made me wonder</a> how we might build software without reinventing the form each
time.</p>
<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center">
<img src="diagram.png" style="max-width:260px" />
<p style="max-width:260px"><b>Figure 2.</b> Grouping interdependent requirements from <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2">Notes</a></p>
</div>
<p>The second part of <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2" title="Notes on the Synthesis of Form - Christopher Alexander">Notes</a> was a bit of a surprise. It takes an unexpectedly formal approach
to architecture. It proposes a design method where problem is decomposed into a large number
of individual sub-problems. You then create a massive graph with links between interconnected
sub-problems, divide it into sub-graphs (components) that are as independent as possible and
then design a solution by independently solving problems in each component (Figure2). The two
appendices in the book are a massive listing of a sample a graph and a detailed explanation of a
decomposition algorithm implemented for IBM 7090.</p>
<p>After reading the <a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless Way</a>, this finally started making sense!
Traditional cultures have working knowledge of building processes as part of their living
culture. What the work on pattern languages tries to do is to make this <em>implicit</em> knowledge
of traditional cultures <em>explicit</em> in a written form. Patterns capture reusable ways of
resolving combinations of forces that one can relatively easily adopt and apply. The graph
decomposition that confused me in the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2" title="Notes on the Synthesis of Form - Christopher Alexander">Notes</a> was all about identifying the combinations
of forces (sub-problems) that have to be resolved together (using a pattern) so that patterns
are relatively independent and can be applied one after another. (A pattern language is not
just a collection of patterns, but also an ordering. It tells you in which order to go through
the patterns in order to design a house or a town.)</p>
<h2>Ways of building</h2>
<p>My recent reading includes books that document work by traditional cultures (<a href="https://amzn.to/3Pyjjxb" title="Architecture Without Architects: A Short Introduction to Non-Pedigreed Architecture - Bernard Rudofsky">Architecture without
Architects</a>), that are rooted in modernism (<a href="https://amzn.to/3SVcV61" title="The Philosophy of Design - Glenn Parsons">The Philosophy of Design</a>), as well as
some that critically reflect on post-modernism (<a href="https://amzn.to/3K1Jlru" title="Irony; or, The Self-Critical Opacity of Postmodern Architecture - Emmanuel J. Pettit">Irony; or, The Self-Critical Opacity of Postmodern
Architecture</a>). So I was quite naturally wondering how to classify Alexander's ideas.</p>

</div>
<p>He was described as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/arts/christopher-alexander-dead.html">"fierce anti-modernist" who "championed vernacular
structures"</a>.
He makes it clear that we cannot go back to the traditional way of building, because the
knowledge has disappeared from our culture and the problem has became more complex. The number
of variables that one needs to think when building a modern office is greater than that of
a farmhouse. So, Alexander does not advocate that we should actually follow the same method
as the traditional cultures. What is then the method that Alexander describes in <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2" title="Notes on the Synthesis of Form - Christopher Alexander">Notes</a>
and <a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless Way</a>?</p>
<p>My answer would probably not make him very happy, but I ended up thinking of his method as
a sort of "implicit modernism". Let me explain! At least in theory, the idea of modernism is
based on the mantra "form follows function". In other words, if you understand perfectly how a
product or a building needs to be used, your design should have exactly what is needed for this
function and nothing more. This is the theory. Of course, you can never know what exactly you
will need, it is almost impossible to design for all the requirements and, as it turns out, people
like decorations. But the theory behind "form follows function" is all about achieving a perfect
fit for a given situation. Modernism tries to do this by collecting all the requirements (as
software engineers might say) and then inventing a new form from scratch to solve those.
(A software engineer might also not be surprised this does not work, because it looks too
much like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall</a> methodology!)</p>
<p>Alexander may be a fierce anti-modernist, but his work is also about resolving a system of
forces. He refers to the <em>quality without a name</em> which appears when all forces are resolved.
He believes that the quality without a name emerges in traditional or vernacular buildings,
because their patterns have been shaped by generations and gradually adapted to resolve all the
forces that such architecture faces. (And he believes that explicit pattern languages can
recover this way of building.) Nevertheless, he is also interested in achieving a perfect fit
for a given situation.</p>
<p>In the introduction to <a href="https://amzn.to/3bZw1Y2" title="Notes on the Synthesis of Form - Christopher Alexander">Notes</a>, Alexander says that design is "the process of
inventing physical things which display new physical order, organization, form, in response to
function," which suggests that he may not be disagreeing with the basic "form follows function"
idea. He does, however, believe that this cannot be achieved by "some arbitrarily chosen formal
order," which is how modernist designers and architects work.</p>
<p>In my very simplistic and surely naïve summary, there are four ways of designing or building things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Traditional</strong> - In this case, the design follows unwritten rules of thumb (or <a href="https://amzn.to/3AuuOBo" title="Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy - Michael Polanyi">personal
knowledge</a>) that are known in the community, but are not written down explicitly.
Those have evolved over time and they lead to solutions that fit well, but it only works when
the problems are relatively simple and do not change quickly.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Explicit modernism</strong> - The design is created directly by an architect or a designer who
tries to find the form to fit the problem (function), often by using some formal order.
This also works for relatively simple problems that one can fully analyze.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Implicit modernism</strong> - The design follows a "living" pattern language that is maintained by
the community. This is constructed jointly by an architect and the users of the language.
It achieves a good fit partly because it is well-constructed (drawing on past experience)
and partly because the pattern language is continually maintained and evolved in the community.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Postmodernism</strong> - In this case, the design is less about finding a good fit and more
about explicitly "showing off", often through explicit references. It may use ideas from modernism
or traditional cultures, but often with critical or ironic take, designed to either
reveal something or to be (sarcastically?) appealing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a somewhat unexpected way, the four ways of building seem to match quite well with four of the
<a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/drafts/cultures/" title="Cultures of programming Understanding the history of programming through controversies and technical artifacts (old draft) - Tomas Petricek">cultures of programming</a> that I wrote about in my (now outdated and under revision) paper.
<em>Hackers</em> often rely on unwritten knowledge; <em>mathematicians</em> try to perfectly analyze problems
and use formal methods to solve them; <em>engineers</em> try to come up with good reliable methods
to solve problems, rooted in practical experience; <em>artists</em> (or proponents of the creative
culture) use programming to imagine new approaches and critically question existing practices.</p>
<h2>Generality of the Timeless way</h2>
<p>One critical point that I think can be made about the <a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless Way</a> is that
it does not separate the very general method based on using a pattern language from the
specific pattern language that Alexander is developing and that, I expect, is fully described
in <a href="https://amzn.to/3wecpGG" title="A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction - Christopher Alexander">The Pattern Language</a>. In other words, does the Timeless Way of building have to
use Alexander's patterns, or is that anything built according to any "living"
community-maintained pattern language?</p>
<h3>Particular character of the timeless way</h3>
<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center">
<img src="holesovice.jpg" style="max-width:400px;border:5px solid black" />
<p style="max-width:400px"><b>Figure 3.</b> A street in Prague, Holešovice (Yes, the
  row of parked cars could be replaced by a bike lane...)</p>
</div>
<p>On a more personal note, I recently moved to Prague (Figure 3) and find it a very nice place,
but very few of the specific design patterns that Alexander describes can be applied to it.
On the other hand, things that matter (to me) in that environment are not captured by
Alexander's patterns. This is quite understandable, because Alexander is writing about
architecture that exists in a different context (and, as he says patterns vary from culture to
culture), but it is not clear if he believes that the community needs (to start from) his
specific set of patterns to achieve the quality without a name, or whether there are
completely different pattern languages.</p>
<p>Alexander says that "buildings produced by the timeless way have a particular character" (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">The
Timeless Way</a>, p.519), but he also says that this "specific character [is] the only
one compatible with life" (dtto., p.526). I am quite convinced that buildings produced by
the timeless way have a specific pleasant character, but I think it is not necessarily clear
why those should be the only ones. (They may, however, be the only ones we can produce somewhat
reliably without guessing and being extremely lucky!)</p>
<p>The mathematician in me starts thinking about an equivalence that you can prove by showing
implication in both directions. That is, "being produced by the timeless way" implies
"pleasant building" and "pleasant building" implies "being produced by the timeless way".
I believe Alexander's argument about the forward direction, but I do not think there is enough
evidence about the backward direction.</p>
<h3>Anything goes (with the right language?)</h3>
<p>My occasional co-conspirator <a href="https://twitter.com/amb26ponder">Antraning Basman</a> likes to refer
to an exchange between the philosophers of science Paul Feyerabend, who advocated for the
"Anything Goes" position and Imre Lakatos who had a theory of "scientific research programmers"
according to which scientists follow rules defined within the research programme. Feyerabend's
reply to Lakatos was, reportedly, that the methodology of research programmes is so lax that
it, in fact, allows for the "Anything Goes" method.</p>
<p>If we accept only the methodology of Alexander's pattern languages, but not his aesthetics,
then I think a similar thing to the above argument can let us claim that all pleasant buildings
can be created from a pattern language. That said, it seems to me that if you find a pleasant
building what was not created by following a pattern language (a lucky accident, perhaps),
then there is no obvious way of reconstructing the pattern language that would lead to its
creation.</p>
<h2>Patterns and software</h2>
<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center">
<img src="space.jpg" style="max-width:400px;border:5px solid black" />
<p style="max-width:400px"><b>Figure 4.</b> "Patterns of events are always interlocked with certain
geometric patterns in the space" from <a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe">The Timeless Way</a>, p.75 and p.80.</p>
</div>
<p>Reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">The Timeless Way</a> makes it quite clear that the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Cd7sBv" title="Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software - Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides">GoF patterns</a> are
not a very faithful adaptation of the idea of design patterns to software. They are, at least
in principle, about resolving competing forces, but they are way too low-level and static.
(Gang of four patterns are about bricks, not feelings!)</p>
<p>Alexander's patterns are about designing a place where one feels that everything fits in place
and the "structure of the space supports [specific] patterns of events" (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless</a>, p.83).
I think this makes it clear that design patterns are not about static code structure and
the program evaluation that it supports, but about the dynamic behaviour of a system and human
interacting with it. I do not see much how this applies to Java code (except, perhaps, when thinking
about code maintenance), but I think it can be useful for thinking about programming languages
and their communities, programming environments and, most generally, programming systems (in the sense
defined in our work on <a href="https://github.com/jdjakub/papers/blob/master/prog-2022/prog22-master.pdf" title="Technical Dimensions of Programming Systems - Joel Jakubovic, Jonathan Edwards, Tomas Petricek">Technical Dimensions of Programming Systems</a> or Richard P. Gabriel's
<a href="https://dreamsongs.com/Files/Incommensurability.pdf" title="The Structure of Programming Language Revolution - Richard P. Gabriel">illuminating paper</a> about paradigm shift from the "system" to the "language" view.)</p>
<p>Alexander is talking about systems that live and grow. "The pattern language, like a seed, is
the genetic system which gives our millions of small acts the power to form a whole"
(<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless</a>, p.351). He likens cities and buildings to living organisms. The pattern
language is like the genetic code that controls the process of growth and, interestingly, also
the process of maintenance, because "there is no difference between the way the genes control
the process of genetic growth which forms the embryo, and the process of repair which heals the
cut" (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless</a>, p.356). The biological metaphor has also been, repeatedly, invoked
when talking about programming systems. Most notably, by Alan Kay in his talk <a href="https://archive.org/details/AlanKayAtOOPSLA1997TheComputerRevolutionHasntHappenedYet">The Computer Revolution
Hasn't Happened Yet</a>
at OOPSLA 1997. Kay uses the metaphor not so much to talk about growth and repair, but instead
about scaling. "If you take things like dog houses, they don't scale by a factor of a hundred very
well." In other words, you cannot build a cathedral by making a dog house 100x bigger. But
"[t]ake things like cells, they not only scale by factors of a hundred, but by factors of a
trillion, and the question is, how do they do it, and how might we adapt this idea for building
complex systems."</p>
<p>This is probably where one potential for a better use of pattern languages in programming may be.
If we had a pattern language that would provide for not just growth (production), but also
repair (maintenance) of software systems, perhaps we would be able to get closer to Kay's dream
of systems that scale by a factor of trillion.</p>
<h2>The Timeless Way of programming</h2>
<p>I <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/metaphors/" title="Programming as Architecture, Design, and Urban Planning - Tomas Petricek">have written</a> about some of the ways in which programming could learn from design,
architecture and urban planning before. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless Way</a> adds a number of other
possible ideas. This section is a very brief summary of some of those ideas.</p>
<h3>From maintenance to living</h3>
<p>Traditional software development processes strictly separate <em>development</em> and <em>maintenance</em>.
This is less the case when we talk about systems that are constantly evolving (say, a system like
Twitter that is always evolving), but even then, such systems consist of components that
programmers see as being maintained. As hinted above, I think Alexander's ideas (in contrast to
those of conventional architects) are much more suitable for a way of thinking that does not
see the two as separate phases.</p>
<p>Moving to a more organic thinking in terms of <em>growth</em> is clearly not just technical, but also
a social problem. The social aspects are subject of the recent book <a href="https://amzn.to/3CKtmfL" title="The Innovation Delusion: How Our Obsession with the New Has Disrupted the Work That Matters Most - Lee Vinsel, Andrew L. Russell">The Innovation
Delusion</a>, which documents our obsession with "innovation". The book makes some nice
points, such as the fact that "Replacing 'progress' with 'innovation' skirts the question of
whether a novelty is an  improvement." The key point of the book is that the imbalance between how
society values innovation and maintenance is leading to major issues, not just in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/tech-giants-chastened-by-heartbleed-finally-agree-to-fund-openssl/">open-source
software</a>,
but also in areas such as domestic labour. (You can get most of the book from just reading the
annotation, though...) The authors do not have a solution, but seems to argue for a more
reputable and professional status of maintainers. However, what if we instead transformed how
we think about software development so that growth (production) is just a limited special case
of living or <em>repair</em> in the sense used by Alexander:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]n this new use of the word repair, we assume, instead, that every entity is changing
constantly: and that at every moment we use the defects of the present state as
the starting point for the definition of the new state.</p>
<p>When we repair something in this new sense, we assume that we are going to transform it,
that new wholes will be born, that, indeed, the entire whole which is being repaired will
become a different whole (...).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Shared pattern languages</h3>
<p>The key concept in <a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">The Timeless Way</a> is the idea of a <em>pattern language</em>. This is
a collection of patterns that is ordered and can be followed to produce a design with the
quality without a name. Pattern languages are not static though. Each culture has their own
and the pattern languages should evolve. The evolution is vital (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless</a>, p.241):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So long as the people of society are separated from the language which is being used to
shape their buildings, the buildings cannot be alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The task of architects is to guide the creation of a shared pattern language that the whole
community can then adopt and use for their designs. This then creates not just buildings that
fit their user's needs, but also entire fitting cities that are composed of a small number of
fitting units.</p>
<p>The idea of shared evolving language, that is created with and modified by its users,
is something that could be leveraged more in the world of programming. According to the
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?HistoryOfPatterns">History of Patterns</a>, this is, indeed, much more
how design patterns were first used by Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham.</p>
<p>One are where something like "shared evolving pattern language" may be a good fit is for
idiomatic programming styles. For example, one thing that I find remarkable about the F#
language is that it is used in a fairly consistent way across the community. I'm not quite sure
how this happened, but it helped the language avoid tensions between different styles and
duplication of efforts in library development. (In contrast, Scala has a reputation for being
used as "Java with lambdas" by one group and "Haskell with objects" as a completely separate
group.) Although the F# style is documented in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/style-guide/">style guide</a>,
I do not think this is the way the living F# pattern language is maintained. It seems
more likely to me that this is knowledge shared implicitly through e.g., contributing to
and learning from other open-source projects.
In any case, having an evolving pattern language, shared by a large community is a
good way of building software, or, like in the case of F#, an ecosystem of software components
that fit well together.</p>
<p>The shared pattern language can, possibly, solve the problem identified by Fred Brooks
in <a href="https://amzn.to/3Tvgikr" title="Mythical Man-Month, The: Essays on Software Engineering - Frederick Brooks, Jr.">The Mythical Man-Month</a>, which is that systems must be "conceptually coherent
to a single mind of the user". This can be achieved if the system is designed by a single
architect, but it is hard to achieve for systems designed by a group of people.
Brooks' answer was to use a hierarchical team structure (mentioning the, now somewhat
amusing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_programmer_team">Chief programmer team</a> methodology).
Christopher Alexander seems to have a solution to this problem that works for non-hierarchical
structures too (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless</a>, p.432):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] group of people who use a common pattern language can make a design together
just as well as a single person can within his mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Slow software development</h3>
<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center">
<img src="fallingwater.jpg" style="max-width:450px;border:5px solid black" />
<p style="max-width:450px"><b>Figure 5.</b> Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright - an example
of "natural" architecture that is not egoless.</p>
</div>
<p>Another characteristic that Alexander emphasizes is that "we can only make a building live when
we are egoless" (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless</a>, p.535). This is the case for a fruit stand, made of simple
corrugated iron and plywood or a diesel-engined fishing boat of three Danish brothers (with a huge
pile of empty beer bottles in one corner). It is markedly not the case for "natural" architects
or "funky relaxed hippie-style architecture". Both of these are trying too hard to look like they
fit, but they fail to do so.</p>
<p>The idea of buildings that are "not trying to impress" reminded me of the way some low-cost
software projects evolve. A lot of my projects are done in this way. There are open-source projects
that I started by putting an F# script file on GitHub that, a couple of years later, gradually
evolved into something that is used by the community and maintained by completely new contributors.
There are academic projects that I return to every now and then, often after a several month-long
breaks and also <a href="https://fsharpworks.com/workshops.html">course materials</a> that I keep updating,
revising and changing over years. Many of these have the egoless character, partly because
they are so low-cost and (to quote Alexander, <a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless</a>, p.537) "the people who
made them simply do not care what people think of them" as long as they work.</p>
<p>I think critical reflection on how "slow software" is made would be very interesting. For example,
you typically cannot depend on anything that changes at a faster rate than your slow project,
which is why my "slow" projects tend to have very few dependencies. It is easier to put together
a simple version of a <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Talks/blob/master/2018/write-your-own-excel/code/src/helpers/elmish.fs">functional UI library</a>
than to use the <a href="https://elmish.github.io/elmish/">real one</a>, which is much more powerful and
efficient, but is likely to evolve each time I get back to a "slow" project.</p>
<p>There is a recent call for <a href="https://robinwinslow.uk/slow-software-development">Slow software development</a>
by Robin Winslow, who also suggests that good software needs to be developed and designed
more slowly. I think the "egoless" character that Christopher Alexander calls for may be
an interesting idea to start from.</p>
<h3>Modular components</h3>
<p>Another topic of relevance to software that Alexander talks much about is the use of
modular components. In software development, modularity is a term of such importance that it
has a whole <a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/modularity">computer science conference</a> named after
itself. At least since the 1970s work on <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361598.361623" title="On the Criteria to Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules - David Parnas">Decomposing Systems into Modules</a>, we
have been trying to build software using components that can be, at least in principle, reused.
First of all, this is not how nature works (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless</a>, p. 144):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature is full of almost similar units (waves, raindrops, blades of
grass) - but though the units of one kind are all alike in their broad structure, no two are
ever alike in detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not some quirky aspect of the nature, but an essential characteristics of a system where
"a part of the world is so well reconciled to its own inner forces that it is true to its own
nature" (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CeIrGe" title="The Timeless Way of Building - Christopher Alexander">Timeless</a>, p.148). In other words, if a system is supposed to fit then
each pattern must be used in a way that fits the specific context. It will be generally the same
structure, but with notable differences in detail.</p>
<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center">
<img src="leninka.jpg" style="max-width:450px;border:5px solid black" />
<p style="max-width:450px"><b>Figure 7.</b> Sídliště Červený Vrch - a housing estate from the
1960s, built from pre-fab concrete panels (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel%C3%A1k">Panelák</a>).</p>
</div>
<p>This is perhaps where comparing patterns with language features (e.g., the Strategy pattern
is just a lambda function in "better" programming languages!) falls short. The point of the pattern
is to describe a general structure that can be adapted, whereas a language feature is a concrete
implementation that will always be the same.</p>
<p>However, there are, of course, good arguments to be made in favour of modular components.
Production cost is the most obvious one. This was the case for brutalist housing estates in the
UK and communist housing built from pre-fab concrete panels. This housing has fallen
out of favour, but is slowly gaining new appreciation. In the UK, Owen Hatherley's <a href="" title="Militant Modernism - Owen Hatherley">Militant
Modernism</a>, labelled as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/09/militant-modernism-owen-hatherley-reviewed">"manifesto for a reborn socialist
modernism"</a>
defends the social visions behind UK's brutalist housing estates. In Czechia,
Paneláky (Figure 7) remain a commonplace housing for a wide range of social classes and
are slowly losing their negative connotations.</p>
<p>I suppose that Alexander's answer to the issue of costs is that buildings produced by following
The Timeless Way can largely be constructed by their own users. That way, you can produce
something unique at a cost that is reasonably affordable. This then, of course, contributes
very significantly to the "particular character" of the buildings produced by following the
Timeless Way as you have to use relatively unsophisticated techniques that can be mastered
by someone who does not have professional training.</p>
<p>What can developers learn from architects about modular components? Alexander's point that
direct reuse of modular components can never resolve all inner forces seems to be valid to me.
Even in software, each application has subtly different needs. One thing that we can do in
software, which does not work that well in building, is to copy and adapt. Having a programming
system that has a first-class support for copy and paste, as imagined by <a href="https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1201">Jonathan Edwards several
years ago</a> would be one step in this direction.
Using materials that a non-programmer can use to build a system they need on their own would
be another option. This may well be why Excel is so widely used. (And if you are thinking that
no-code or low-code is the answer, see my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2022/no-code-substrates/">previous post on those systems</a>.)</p>
