  Functional programming languages have been around for a while and were always astonishing for their 
  ability to express the ideas in a succinct, declarative way allowing the developer to focus on the 
  essence of problem rather than on technical details of the solution. Recently, functional paradigm is 
  gaining new prominence as an efficient way to handle development of multi-processor, parallel and 
  asynchronous applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:0px; font-style:italic">
  Functional ideas are arising in C# as well as in other main-stream languages and functional languages 
  are becoming an alternative for real-world projects.  Also, Microsoft recently introduced a new 
  language called F#, which has a strong background in traditional functional languages, but as a .NET 
  language also benefits from the rich .NET and Visual Studio ecosystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:0px; font-style:italic">
  This article is partially an excerpt from my book <strong><a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a></strong> [<a href="#fpgpref">1</a>]. 
  Thanks to my editors at <a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external">Manning</a> I have the permission
  to publish it on my blog. We’ll look at several aspects of functional programming and how the same 
  concepts, which are essential for the functional paradigm, look in the F# and in C# 3.0 with LINQ. We 
  will shortly look at the basic programming language features like lambda functions and type inference 
  that are now available in both F# and C#. Functional programming isn’t only about language features, 
  but also about using different programming style, so we’ll look at some high level concepts as well. 
  These include using immutable data structures for developing code that can be executed in parallel 
  and writing code in a more declarative style.</p>

<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; margin-bottom:30px; text-indent:0px; font-style:italic">
  Thanks to the combination of C# 3.0 and F#, this article shows the ideas in a way that should be 
  familiar to you in C#, but also shows a further step that you can take with a primarilly functional
  language F#. If you're a .NET developer and you want to understand what functional programming is
  and how it can help you to become better and more productive then continue reading. If you'll find 
  this article interesting, then don't forget to check out the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">book</a>,
  which explains everything in larger detail and discusses many other interesting ideas.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Functional programming differs from the usual imperative and object oriented style in many ways, so I’d
  like to start this article with an introduction of the basic concepts that are essential for 
  functional programming. There are many different functional languages and every language puts 
  emphasis on a slightly different set of concepts, but the ideas presented in section 1 are shared by 
  almost all functional languages. </p>

<p>After introducing the core concepts, we’ll look at the F# language in the section 2. F# existed for a 
  several years as a project developed and maintained by Don Syme at Microsoft Research. Recently, 
  Microsoft announced that F# is being productized, so it is now joining the family of Visual Studio 
  languages. F# isn’t purely functional language, but instead mixes the best from many styles, 
  including functional and object-oriented. It is also a .NET language, so we’ll look how to use .NET 
  libraries (like Windows Forms) from F#. As already mentioned, features typical for functional languages are 
  now available in many non-functional 
  languages like C# 3.0, Visual Basic and Python. We’ll look at three examples showing how the same 
  idea looks in a primarily functional F# language and in C# in section 4.</p>

<p>In particular we’ll look at the list type known from many functional languages and how it relates to 
  the iterators and the <code>IEnumerable</code> type in C# 2.0. Next, we’ll look at lambda functions, which is 
  arguably the most essential feature of functional languages. Lambda functions are one of the 
  additions to C# in the 3.0 version. The next feature that we’ll look at is generics and type inference.
  The development of generics for C# and .NET 2.0 was largely influenced by F#, so we’ll see how 
  generics are important for F#. Type inference, which simplifies declaration of variables in C# 3.0, 
  is also rooted in functional programming. The succinctness of the F# programming style is possible 
  only thanks to the use of type inference, but thanks to the combination with generics we can get the 
  usual safety of statically typed languages.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll focus our attention to topics that are very important nowadays and we’ll discuss parallel 
  and asynchronous programming. Parallel execution means that two pieces of code execute at the same 
  time (for example on a multi-core processor). As we’ll see functional programs avoid using global 
  mutable state, which eliminates the common source of problems and makes writing parallel programs 
  easier. Asynchronous programming refers to something different – when writing program that performs I/O
  operations or accesses web services, we often want to start executing some operation and wait until 
  it finishes (e.g. web request), but writing this using methods like <code>BeginInvoke</code> is difficult, so we’ll 
  look at the F# solution in section 4.</p>

<p>Finally, in the last section of this article, we’ll discuss a different point of view at programs 
  that can be used when writing code and which is very useful when thinking about functional programs. 
  We’ll see that library can be viewed as a language that specifies how we can some particular type of 
  problems. We’ll shortly get back to lists and look at the library for working with lists and I’ll 
  demonstrate an example from a more complex solution for developing animations in a functional way.</p>

<h2>1&#160;&#160;The elements of functional style</h2>

<h3>1.1&#160;&#160;Values instead of variables</h3>

<p>First of all, functional programs don’t usually have typical variables that are used for storing a 
  state of some operation, by reading and writing a value of the variable after executing a single 
  operation. Variables in functional languages are instead immutable, meaning that the value of 
  variable can’t change after it has been initialized. This is a reason why functional languages 
  usually use the term “value” instead of “variable”. </p>

<p>Let me demonstrate what I mean using an example. Let’s say we want to write a program that takes 0 as 
  an initial value, reads two numbers from the console, adds the first number to the initial value and 
  multiplies the result by the second number. A typical implementation of something like this in C# 
  would look like this:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
int res = 0;
res = res + ReadInt32();
res = res * ReadInt32();
WriteInt32(res);
</pre>

<p>As you can see, we created a variable <code>res</code> and modified it two times when reading the input value from 
  the console. Now, let’s look at the same code implemented without modifying a value of variables:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
int res0 = 0;
int res1 = res0 + ReadInt32();
int res2 = res1 * ReadInt32();
WriteInt32(res2);
</pre>

<p>Because we didn’t want to modify the value of existing variable we declared a new variable (<code>res0</code>, <code>res1</code>,
  <code>res2</code>) every time we wanted to calculate a new value. The key difference is that in the second 
  example, we didn’t use the assignment operator (written as an equal sign in C#). The only occurrence 
  of this symbol in a second example is when initializing a variable value, which has a different 
  meaning then assignment operator – instead of changing a value of an existing variable it creates a 
  new variable with a specified initial value.</p>

<h3>1.2&#160;&#160;Programming using recursion</h3>

<p>You can probably imagine how to write some extremely simple programs without using traditional 
  variables and assignment operator, but once you start thinking about slightly more complicated 
  problems, things become difficult. Let’s look at the following function, which sums numbers in a 
  specified range (this can be of course calculated directly, but I’ll use it as an example of a 
  calculation which uses a loop): </p>

<pre lang="csharp">
int SumNumbers(int from, int to) {
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = from; i &lt;= to; i++)
        res = res + i;
    return res;
}
</pre>

<p>In this case, we just can’t directly replace variable with value bindings, because we need to modify 
  the value during every evaluation of the loop. The program needs to keep certain state and the state 
  is changed during every execution of the loop, so we can’t declare a new variable for every change of 
  the state. Thus we need to do a more fundamental change in the code and use a technique called 
  recursion instead of using loops:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
int SumNumbers(int from, int to) {
    if (from &gt; to) 
        return 0;
    int sumRest = SumNumbers(from + 1, to);
    return from + sumRest;
}
</pre>

<p>As you probably already know, recursion means that a function (<code>SumNumbers</code> in our case) calls itself 
  (in our case this is when we calculate a value for <code>sumRest</code> variable). In this code, we’re using only 
  value binding, so it is using only purely functional features. The state of the computation, which 
  was originally stored in a mutable variable, is now expressed using recursion. As you may guess from 
  this introduction, the use of values instead of variables and keeping program state using recursion 
  is an important feature whenever you want to write any interesting F# program.</p>

<h3>1.3&#160;&#160;Functions as values</h3>

<p>Writing almost every program using recursion explicitly would be rather difficult, so functional 
  languages have developed a ways that allow us to write the “difficult recursive part” of the program 
  only once and use it in many variations for different purposes. How can we separate the functionality 
  that will vary during every use from a recursive part of the code? The answer is simple – we will 
  write the recursive part as a function with parameters and these parameters will specify what “unique 
  operation” that the function should perform.</p>

<p>Let me demonstrate the idea on a previous example. We wrote a function that takes an initial value, 
  loops through a specified numeric range and calculates a new “state” of the calculation during every 
  iteration using the previous state and the current number from the range. In the function above we 
  used zero as an initial value and we used addition as an operation that is used to fold the numbers 
  in the range, so a resulting computation for a range from 5 to 10 would look like <code>(((((0 + 5) + 6) + 7) + 8) + 9) + 10</code>. </p>

<p>What if we now decided to modify this function to be more general and allow us to perform 
  computations using different operations, for example multiply all numbers in the range and generate 
  the following computation: <code>(((((1 * 5) * 6) * 7) * 8) * 9) * 10</code>? If you think about the differences 
  between these two computations, you’ll see that there are only two changes. First, we changed the 
  initial value from 0 to 1 (because we don’t want to multiply any result of a call by zero!) and we 
  changed the operator used during the computation. 
  To make the code more general, we’d like to write a method <code>AggregateNumbers</code> that takes the initial 
  value as an argument and a function, which would specify the operation that is used for aggregating 
  the numbers. This function should take two integers as an argument and should return an integer as a result.</p>

<p>We’ll see how to write a function like this in both C# and F# in the next section. The use of 
  functions as an argument is called using functions as values, because we use a function in a place 
  where other values are used such as method argument or return value. Hiding recursion in a function 
  or method that accepts a function value as an argument is a very powerful technique and we’ll see it 
  in the example demonstrating working with lists as well.</p>

<h3>1.4&#160;&#160;Immutable data structures</h3>

<p>We already discussed that functional languages prefer to use value bindings instead of variables and 
  we’ve seen how it influences the programming style. The approach not to use mutable values isn’t 
  limited just to variables and extends to a declaration of all functional data types. 
  Functional data types are usually immutable as well, which means that a value of the type cannot 
  change. The only way we can change a value is by creating a copy with a modified value. Even though 
  it may seem a bit strange for the first time, it isn’t actually that uncommon. An example that you 
  already know is a <code>string</code> type, which is immutable in .NET. This means that all operations performed 
  on strings return a copy and don’t modify the original value:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
string input = "hElLo wOrLD!";
string first = input.Substring(0, 1).ToUpper();
string rest = input.Substring(1).ToLower();
string result = first + rest;
</pre>

<p>As you can see in this example, working with immutable data types is quite simple. Instead of 
  modifying the value, we just declare a variable and store the new value returned by the operation in 
  this variable and leave the original value unchanged. Of course, this approach can be used for other 
  data types as well. Let’s look for example at the type for storing a collection of integers 
  implemented as an immutable data structure:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
FunctionalList list0 = FunctionalList.Empty();
FunctionalList list1 = list0.Add(1);
FunctionalList list2 = list1.Add(3);
FunctionalList list3 = list2.Add(5);
FunctionalList list4 = list3.Add(7);
</pre>

<p>To construct a list of integers, we need just two basic operations – on the first line, we need to 
  create an empty list (called <code>Empty</code>) and in the rest of the example, we’re just adding element to the 
  existing list, which is an operation (called <code>Add</code> in this example) that returns a new list composed 
  from the original list and the new element. This previous example can be of course written more 
  elegantly, without declaring all the unnecessary temporary variables. We could just call the <code>Add</code> 
  operation straight away on the returned temporary list:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
FunctionalList res = FunctionalList.Empty().Add(1).Add(3).Add(5).Add(7);
</pre>

<p>You’re probably thinking that copying the whole list every time we want to add a new member to the 
  list is inefficient. This would be of course true, but we don’t actually have to copy the whole list. 
  Let’s say that we have a list <code>l1</code> containing 1, 2, 3 and want to append 0 at the beginning. Instead of 
  copying the whole content of <code>l1</code>, we can simply create an object (for example <code>l2</code>) that contains the 
  new value (0) and a reference to the original list (<code>l2</code>). This wouldn’t work for a mutable list, 
  because if we modified some element in l2, it would also change the original list (<code>l1</code>). Since we’re 
  working with immutable data structures, none of the lists can be changed, so keeping just a reference 
  to the original list is a correct approach.</p>

<h3>1.5&#160;&#160;The absence of side effects</h3>

<p>The use of immutable data types means that a code cannot perform any side-effect. By side-effect I 
  mean for example modifying a value of global variable. A function written in this way is much closer 
  to the mathematical notion of a function and is usually called pure function by functional programmers.</p>

<p>Functions like this are very interesting, because they have similar properties as mathematical 
  functions. The only thing that the function can do is to return a value, which means that the order 
  of evaluation is not important and evaluating a function two times leads always to the same result. 
  This means that the following two examples perform exactly the same thing:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
FunctionalList l = GetData();
return ProcessList(l) + ProcessList(l);
</pre>

<p>In the second version, we optimize the code to run the <code>ProcessList</code> function only once:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
FunctionalList l = GetData();
int tmp = ProcessList(l);
return tmp + tmp;
</pre>

<p>Indeed, you would expect that this code does the same thing, but it isn’t always true in imperative 
  programming, because <code>ProcessList</code> can modify some global variable, so running it just once instead of 
  twice changes the meaning of the program.</p>

<p>So far I mentioned modifying global variable as the only side-effect, but to be a truly pure function 
  (meaning that the result depends solely on the arguments), it also cannot perform any I/O operation, 
  like reading from or writing to a file, communicating over the network or interacting with the user. 
  In F#, you can do all these operations, but the way you write the code helps you to prevent from 
  mistakes that can be caused by using side-effects in a place where you wouldn’t expect them.</p>

<p>Minimizing the use of side-effects is very useful if you want to have clearer way for thinking about 
  the code, but it is also extremely valuable when developing applications that run on multi-core 
  systems. We’ll see an example demonstrating why avoiding side effects is important shortly in section 4.</p>

<h2>2&#160;&#160;F#: The functional .NET language</h2>

<p>Before we can continue our discussion about functional programming in general, let’s look at several 
  practical examples in the F# language. As already mentioned, F# is a .NET language, so we can access .
  NET libraries, but there is also a lot of functionality in the F# libraries, that is suited 
  especially for functional programming in F#.</p>

<p>To present F#, I decided to write several “Hello world” examples. We’ll start with the most classic 
  version, which prints the message to a screen. To show something more complicated, I implemented two 
  more “Hello world” examples that we’ll examine later. Next one presents a recursive function for 
  calculating factorial, which is a “Hello world” example used in functional programming and the last 
  one is a graphical “Hello world” showing how to use basic Windows Forms controls and event in F#.</p>

<p>F# can be downloaded from the F# Web site [<a href="#fpgpref">2</a>] and it contains integration with Visual Studio (you can 
  even use the free Shell version [<a href="#fpgpref">3</a>]). In the following examples we’ll use the simplest way to play 
  with F#, which is to use the F# interactive tool. It can be used either from console (<code>fsi.exe</code>) or 
  from Visual Studio. After creating new F# project in Visual Studio, you can simply highlight a block 
  of F# code and hit [Alt]+[Enter]. This command sends the selected text to the F# interactive window 
  compiles it and executes it, so we can immediately see the results.</p>

<h3>2.1&#160;&#160;Imperative hello world</h3>

<p>Let’s start with the first example from our “Hello world” series. The following listing shows the 
  content of the F# interactive window after entering and executing a line of code that calls the 
  <code>printfn</code> function, which is a function defined in the standard F# library:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
MSR F# Interactive, (c) Microsoft Corporation, All Rights Reserved
F# Version 1.9.4.17, compiling for .NET Framework Version v2.0.50727

&gt; #light
  printfn "Hello world!"
  ;;
Hello world!
val it : unit = ()
</pre>

<p>The first line contains a directive #light, which turns on the lightweight F# syntax – this is a 
  syntax option that simplifies writing  code a lot and we’ll use it in the rest of the article. Next, 
  you can see a line of code with the <code>printfn</code> function followed by a two semicolons - two semicolons 
  are used to terminate the input, so that you can enter multiple lines of text when writing the code 
  directly in F# interactive. As you can see, after entering the command, the message “Hello world” 
  appeared in the console window. Finally, the last line shows the result of the calculation. In F#, 
  you can treat every block of code as a calculation with some result. In this case, the <code>printfn</code> 
  function doesn’t return any value, so it just returns <code>unit</code>, which is something very similar to the 
  <code>void</code> “type” known from C#.</p>

<h3>2.2&#160;&#160;Functional hello world </h3>

<p>Let’s now look at more interesting “Hello world” example, which shows a calculation of the factorial 
  function in F#. If you’re not familiar with factorial, it is a function that takes a number n and 
  returns 1 when n is less than 2 and returns factorial of n – 1 multiplied by n otherwise:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; #light
  // Declaration of the factorial function
  let rec factorial num =
      match num with
      | n when n &lt;= 1 -&gt; 1            // First case branch
      | n -&gt; n * (factorial (n - 1))  // Second case branch
  ;;
val factorial : int -&gt; int

&gt; // Testing the factorial
  factorial 5
val it : int = 120
</pre>

<p>The first command entered to the F# interactive is a declaration of the function to compute the 
  factorial. The function is declared using <code>let rec</code> keyword. This specifies that we’re declaring 
  something (<code>let</code> can be used for declaring simple variables as we’ll see later) and that we’re 
  declaring something recursive (<code>rec</code> can be viewed as a modifier). These keywords are followed by the 
  function name and by the arguments of the function (here we have just one argument called <code>num</code>) and by 
  the equals sign.</p>

<p>The equals sign separates the function header from the body. In our example, the body is just one 
  <code>match</code> expression. This is a very common expression in functional languages and represents the fact 
  that we want to take the value (<code>num</code> in our case) and test whether it satisfies some condition (in a 
  functional terminology we’d say whether it matches a certain pattern) and select the according code 
  branch. In our example, we have just two patterns. The first pattern assigns the value to a variable 
  called <code>n</code> and tests whether <code>n</code> is less than or equal to one. This is written as an additional condition 
  using <code>when</code> clause. The second patter simply assigns the value to a variable called <code>n</code> and doesn’t 
  perform any additional test, so it matches all the remaining situations. The code for both branches 
  is separated by the arrow sign (<code>-&gt;</code>) and either directly returns a value, or performs the recursive 
  call and multiplication.</p>

<p>This code demonstrates one more essential F# feature, which is type inference. If you look at the 
  result printed on the next line, you can see that we declared a function that takes <code>int</code> as an 
  argument and returns <code>int</code> as a result. This may be surprising, because we didn’t specify the type 
  anywhere! What the F# compiler did is that it analyzed the code. It can see that in the first branch, 
  we’re returning a value of type <code>int</code> (constant 1), so it deduced that the return type is an integer. 
  Similarly, we’re subtracting one from the argument <code>n</code> in the second branch, which means that the 
  argument <code>num</code> itself should also be an integer. The type inference mechanism in F# is quite advanced 
  and as you can see it attempts to deduce as much as it can automatically. We’ll talk about type 
  inference in some more detail later in the article.</p>

<h3>2.3&#160;&#160;.NET hello world</h3>
<p>To finish our quick tour of F#, let’s look at simple example that creates Windows Forms “Hello world” 
  application. It creates a simple form with a label on it. You can see the source code in the 
  following listing with a screenshot of the running application below:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; // Import useful .NET namespaces
  open System
  open System.Drawing
  open System.Windows.Forms

  // Create the form and a label objects
  let frm = new Form(Text = "Hello world!", Height = 150)
  let lbl = new Label(Text = "Click here!", Dock = DockStyle.Fill, 
                      TextAlign = ContentAlignment.MiddleCenter)

  // Set ‘Font’ property of the label and add label to the form
  lbl.Font &lt;- new Font("Calibri", 24.0f)
  frm.Controls.Add(lbl)
  frm.Show()
  ;;

val frm : Form
val btn : Label
</pre>

<img src="/articles/functional-overview/winforms1.png" style="margin:15px;float:right" alt="Windows Forms in F#"/>
<p>This example demonstrates several F# features that are essential for accessing .NET components. First,
  you can see the use of open keyword, which makes types from a .NET namespace available in the code, 
  so we don’t have to use full names. </p>

<p>The next block demonstrates creating the controls. This is done by creating standard .NET objects 
  using the usual <code>new</code> keyword for creating objects. As you can see, we’re using the <code>let</code> keyword again, 
  but this time it is used to declare a local value (similar to variables from imperative languages), 
  so here we declare values <code>frm</code> and <code>lbl</code> that hold the reference to our objects representing the controls. </p>

<p>When creating an object instance in F#, it is also possible to specify some properties of the object 
  directly during initialization. You can see this for example in the code that creates the form – the 
  comma separated assignments that are specified after listing all arguments to the constructor (in our 
  case there aren’t any arguments) specify additional properties of the object. For example <code>Text = "Hello world!"</code> 
  when creating the form specifies that the <code>Text</code> property should be initialized with the given string.
  After that, we set the <code>Font</code> property of the label, which is done using operator written as <code>&lt;-</code>, so 
  keep in mind that ordinary equals sign (<code>=</code>) in F# is a comparison that returns bool value and not an 
  assignment! Finally, we call two .NET methods to add label to the form and show the form. If you want 
  to turn this code from an F# interactive script into a Windows application, you’ll have to use 
  <code>Application.Run</code> instead of <code>frm.Show</code>.</p>

<p>Using F# interactive has one interesting advantage – we can develop the program in an iterative style,
  meaning that we can write some code, immediately see the result and then add some features and see 
  how it affects the running program. This is exactly what we’re going to do next – we use the previous 
  example and add some event handling to the code:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; // Create random number generator
  let rnd = new Random()   

  // Function that changes the text of the label and back color of the form
  let handleClick (e:EventArgs) =
      let r = rnd.Next(256) 
      let g = rnd.Next(256)
      let b = rnd.Next(256)
      // Set the text and the new back color
      lbl.Text &lt;- if (lbl.Text = "Tock!") then "Tick!" else "Tock!"
      frm.BackColor &lt;- Color.FromArgb(r, g, b)

  // Add ‘handleClick’ as an event handler to the label
  lbl.Click.Add(handleClick)
  ;;
val rnd : Random
val handleClick : EventArgs -&gt; unit
</pre>

<img src="/articles/functional-overview/winforms2.png" style="margin:15px;float:right" alt="Windows Forms in F#"/>
<p>The code first creates a standard .NET random number generator object, which is then used in the 
  <code>handleClick</code> function for generating a new color of the background. This function will be later used 
  as an event handler for the click event of the label. It takes single argument, because we need to 
  make it compatible with the code for attaching functions as event handlers below. As you can see the 
  argument <code>e</code> isn’t used anywhere in the code, so I added type annotation <code>(e:EventArgs)</code> to specify what 
  is the type of the argument. Actually, the code would work without the type annotation as well thanks 
  to the automatic use of generics in F#, which I’ll talk about shortly later, but I wanted to make it 
  as simple as possible for now.</p>

<p>The next interesting thing is that we’re using <code>if … then … else</code> as an expression, which is not usual 
  in imperative languages. Here, the return value of the <code>if … then … else</code> expression is a string and it 
  can be either "Tick!" or "Tock!" depending on the currently displayed text. Finally, we use the <code>Add</code> 
  method of the <code>Click</code> property to add the function as an event handler for the event. F# works with .
  NET events in a slightly different way than C#, so there is no need to create a delegate explicitly. 
  We can just use directly the function name or even lambda function, which I’ll talk about shortly.</p>

<h2>3&#160;&#160;Real-world functional programming</h2>

<p>In this section, we’ll look at some practical uses of the functional programming concepts introduced 
  in the first section. I’ll start with an example that I already talked about in the first section – 
  that is using functions as arguments to other function in both C# 3.0 and F#. Next, I’ll show you why 
  generics are so important for F#. Finally, we’ll look at some interesting examples that demonstrate 
  how close LINQ in C# 3.0 is to the F# functions for working with collections of data. </p>

<h3>3.1&#160;&#160;Functions in F# and C# 3.0</h3>

<p>Let me just shortly remind you the example that I used earlier when talking about functions in the 
  first section. We started with a code that sums all numbers in a specified range. You can see our 
  original code in the following listing:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
int SumNumbers(int from, int to) {
    if (from &gt; to) 
        return 0;
    int rest = SumNumbers(from + 1, to);
&#160;&#160;   return from + rest;
}
</pre>

<p>The question that we faced was: “How can we make the code more general?” In particular, we wanted to 
  extend the function so that it could either sum all numbers in the range or multiply all numbers in 
  the range.</p>

<h4>Calculating using functions in C#</h4>

<p>To do this, we need to add two additional arguments to the method. The first argument should specify 
  the initial value (as we need to use 1 as a default value instead of 0 when multiplying numbers) and 
  the second argument should specify the operation that should be used on the last line when we’re 
  calculating a result from variables <code>from</code> and <code>rest</code>. Let’s start by looking at the solution in C# 
  language (using the 3.0 version):</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
int AggregateNumbers(Func&lt;int, int, int&gt; f, int init, int from, int to) {
    if (from &gt; to) 
        return init;
    int rest = AggregateNumbers(f, init, from + 1, to);
    return f(from, rest);
}
</pre>

<p><code>Func</code> is a delegate that is defined in <code>System</code> namespace in .NET 3.5. As you probably already know, 
  delegates in .NET are something like a type-safe pointer to a method. This means that we can use 
  delegate for giving some piece of executable code as an argument to other methods. <code>Func</code> in particular 
  is a generic delegate, so we have to provide it with type arguments. Type arguments specify what the 
  parameters and return value of the referenced piece of code are. Just for a review, here is a 
  declaration of the delegate (showing also similar delegate written without generics):</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Declartion of the generic Func delegate with 2 arguments 
delegate TResult Func&lt;T1, T2, TResult&gt;(T1 arg1, T2 arg2); 

// Instance used in our example earlier (without generics):
delegate int Func_IntIntInt(int arg1, int arg2); 
</pre>

<p>Delegates can be used similarly as methods in the code, so on the last line of the <code>AggregateNumbers</code>, 
  we simply invoke the delegate value <code>f</code> instead of adding the numbers using plus operator. In 
  functional programming, we don’t talk about “delegates”, but we work with a simpler concept – a 
  function. In a pure mathematical understanding, function is simply something that takes arguments and 
  returns the result. Indeed, this is exactly what the delegate represents in this example. As we’ll 
  see shortly, in F# we don’t have to use delegates to implement this example and we can use the basic 
  ‘function’ concept directly.</p>

<p>Before looking at the F# version, let’s look at the code that calls <code>AggregateNumbers</code> to perform the 
  two tasks discussed earlier (adding and multiplying numbers in a range). Of course, we could write 
  methods with a compatible signature (for example <code>AddInts</code> and <code>MulInts</code>) and use them as the arguments. 
  Unfortunately that wouldn’t make the code shorter. What we want to do instead is to specify the 
  argument to the <code>AggregateNumbers</code> directly when calling the method. To do this we can use new C# 3.0 
  feature called lambda functions (which is an extension and simplification of anonymous delegates that 
  appeared in C# 2.0):</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Aggregate numbers using "+" and using "*" operators
int r1 = AggregateNumbers( (a, b) =&gt; a + b, 0, 1, 5);
int r2 = AggregateNumbers( (a, b) =&gt; a * b, 1, 1, 5);

// Outputs: "add: 15, mul: 120"
Console.WriteLine("add: {0}, mul: {1}", r1, r2);
</pre>

<p>You can see two examples of lambda functions on the first two lines. The arrow symbol (<code>=&gt;</code>) separates 
  specification of arguments (on the left side) from the body expression on the right side. In both 
  examples, we define a function that takes two arguments (called <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>) and performs some simple 
  calculation with them on the right side.</p>

<p>Lambda functions are another important feature of functional languages. They give us a very simple 
  way to write a function “inline”, so that we can use it as a parameter to method that takes delegate 
  as an argument (in F# it will be just a function instead of delegate). This is particularly useful if 
  the function is simple and isn’t used anywhere else in the code, which is exactly the case of our 
  previous example. Functional programming also uses functions (or delegates) as parameters of other 
  methods quite often, so using lambda functions is very common.</p>

<h4>Calculating using functions in F#</h4>

<p>Let’s now look at exactly the same code implemented in F#. Of course, in F#, we’ll implement 
  <code>aggregateNumbers</code> simply as a function using <code>let rec</code> keyword instead of method in some class:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; let rec aggregateNumbers (f:int -&gt; int -&gt; int) init nfrom nto =
      if nfrom &gt; nto then init else
          let rest = aggregateNumbers f init (nfrom + 1) nto
          f nfrom rest
  ;;
val aggregateNumbers : (int -&gt; int -&gt; int) -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; int
</pre>

<p>Most of the code is similar to the previous C# version. It contains <code>if</code> expression with <code>then</code> branch 
  that returns the initial value (<code>init</code>) and an <code>else</code> branch. The <code>else</code> branch first recursively processes 
  the numbers in a range skipping the first number and then calculates the aggregate value from the 
  first number (<code>nfrom</code>) and recursively calculated result (<code>rest</code>).</p>

<p>What is however interesting is the parameter <code>f</code>, which is a function used for aggregating the numbers. 
  In the header of the function, I added type annotation to it, so that we can see what the function 
  type looks like: <code>int -&gt; int -&gt; int</code>.  This syntax represents a function that takes <code>int</code> as a first 
  argument, another <code>int</code> as a second argument and returns <code>int</code> as well. This is similar to the delegate 
  type that we’ve used earlier. You can also see the type of the whole function <code>aggregateNumbers</code> 
  (printed by the F# interactive). It starts with the type of the <code>f</code> parameter (in braces), followed by 
  three integers. The return type is of course also an integer. 
  To call it, we’ll again use lambda functions, but this time in F#. This represents exactly the same 
  idea as the previous C# version, but with a slightly different syntax:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; aggregateNumbers (fun a b -&gt; a + b) 0 1 5;;
val it : int = 15
</pre>

<p>In F#, lambda functions are written using the fun keyword, which is followed by the declaration of 
  arguments (in our example <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>). The header is ended with a single arrow symbol (<code>-&gt;</code>) and then 
  follows the body of the function.</p>

<h4>Making functions using partial application</h4>

<p>Now we’ve implemented a more general version of the function, which is certainly very useful. On the 
  other side, if we wanted to use it for adding numbers (as <code>sumNumbers</code> did) very often, we’d prefer to 
  declare the more specific function (<code>sumNumbers</code>) as well, so we wouldn’t have to write the additional 
  arguments in every call.</p>

<p>In F# this can be done using partial application, which is also sometimes called currying. It means 
  that we specify only first few arguments of the function and the result will be a function that takes 
  only the remaining arguments. In our case, we’ll specify only the operator for aggregation and the 
  initial value:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; // Declare 'sumNumbers' and 'mulNumbers' using partial application
  let sumNumbers = aggregateNumbers ( + ) 0
  let mulNumbers = aggregateNumbers ( * ) 1
  ;;
val sumNumbers : (int -&gt; int -&gt; int)
val mulNumbers : (int -&gt; int -&gt; int)

&gt; // Test the returned functions:
  sumNumbers 1 5;;
val it : int = 15
&gt; mulNumbers 1 5;;
val it : int = 120
</pre>

<p>On the first two lines, we use partial application to create two specialized functions using 
  <code>aggregateNumbers</code>.  Also note that in F# we can use ordinary operators as parameters. This means that 
  instead of writing the code using lambda function, which calls the operator, we can simply use the 
  operators themselves. </p>

<p>If you look at the signatures printed by the F# interactive, you can see that both sumNumbers and 
  <code>mulNumbers</code> have type <code>int -&gt; int -&gt; int</code>. This is exactly what you get if you “cut off” first two 
  arguments from the <code>aggregateNumbers</code> function. And, as you probably already know, this represents a 
  function that takes two integers (representing the range) and returning an integer.</p>

<p>I think that now you know enough about functions and we can look at some examples where we can use 
  them for some more real-world example. In the next section, I’ll briefly talk about the relation 
  between F# functions for working with collections of data and similar functionality now available in C#
  3.0 and LINQ.</p> 

<h3>3.2&#160;&#160;Functional lists and LINQ</h3>

<p>Since this article is just a short introduction to functional programming, I will not discuss 
  everything in detail (you can find much more information in the book). In particular, I won’t explain 
  how lists are implemented in F# and how you can manipulate with them on the lowest level – that is 
  accessing elements of the list, constructing lists programmatically and so on.</p>

<p>Instead, I’ll demonstrate several interesting similarities between lists in F# and working with 
  collections of data using new C# 3.0 features and LINQ project. This part will demonstrate two things 
  – first, you’ll see how using the new C# 3.0 features makes many daily task easier and second, you’ll 
  see that these new features are directly motivated by functional languages. Later, we’ll see that in 
  functional programming, the same approach is often used also for solving problems other then working 
  with data. The point of the functional style is to make the code more declarative. This means 
  avoiding as many technical details that are not relevant for the problem as possible. </p>

<h4>Creating lists</h4>

<p>Before we can start manipulating with lists, we’ll need to initialize some. In F#, we’ll also 
  reference module called <code>List</code>, which contains useful functions for working with lists (module is 
  something like a namespace, but it can contains functions and not only classes). Similarly, in C# you’ll
  need to add using directive for the <code>System.Linq</code> namespace, which contains LINQ functionality for 
  working with collections.</p>

<p>The code that references <code>List</code> module and initializes list called <code>l</code> in F# looks like this:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; open List;;
&gt; let l = [ 1 .. 10 ];;
val l : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]
</pre>

<p>The list is written in square brackets and can be written by listing all the elements as you can see 
  on the last line, where F# interactive automatically printed the value. We’ve used a second option, 
  which is a simplified notation for creating list containing a range of numbers. In C#, we can use 
  collection initializers to write very similar code:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
var l = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
</pre>

<p>Collection initializers are new feature of C# 3.0 and allow us to use similar expression when 
  initializing (built-in) arrays and when initializing custom collections. This is very simple feature, 
  but has been available in many functional languages for a long time.</p>

<h4>Filtering and projection</h4>

<p>In the upcoming two sections, we’ll look at basic examples of manipulating with items in the list. As 
  I already mentioned, the functional data structures are immutable, which means that all the 
  operations do not actually modify the existing data structure. Instead they return a new list. The 
  examples that demonstrate LINQ in C# use <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> type, so the returned value is calculated on 
  demand (only when we enumerate it using something like <code>foreach</code>), but the idea is essentially the same. </p>

<p>In both cases, we get a new value representing the new data and the original list is not altered in 
  any way. In F#, this isn’t possible, because the list is truly immutable and in C# we don’t do it, 
  because we want to use data collections in a functional way. In section 4 I’ll shortly discuss the 
  key reasons why using immutable structures is a good idea, but now, let’s look at the code.</p>

<p>The first example demonstrates two operations – filtering and projection. Filtering means that we 
  select only elements that fulfill some condition (for example, whether a number is a multiple of three)
  and is similar to the <code>WHERE</code> clause from SQL.  On the other side, projection is similar to the <code>SELECT</code> 
  clause. We can use it to perform some calculation for every element in the list and get a list 
  containing results of these calculations (for example, we can multiply all numbers in the list by two). 
  The code for this is surprisingly similar, so you can see both F# and C# version side by side:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="49%">
<pre lang="fsharp" style="width:100%">
&gt; // Select multiples of three
  let l1 = filter (fun n -&gt; n%3 = 0) l;;
val l1 : int list = [3; 6; 9]

&gt; // Multiply every element by two
  let l2 = map (fun n -&gt; n*2) l1;;
val l2 : int list = [6; 12; 18]&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</pre>
</td><td width="49%">
<pre lang="csharp" style="width:100%">
// Select mutiples of three
var l1 = l.Where(n =&gt; n%3 == 0);
// result l1: [3; 6; 9]

// Multiply every element by two
var l2 = l1.Select(n =&gt; n*2);
// result l2: [6; 12; 18]
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p>To perform filtering, we use a function called <code>filter</code> in F# and an extension method <code>Where</code> in C# 3.0. 
  Both of them take a lambda function that specifies the condition as an argument. Note that the lambda 
  expression takes a single argument (the element in the list) and returns a boolean value specifying 
  whether the condition was satisfied or not. When using the extension method in C#, the list is 
  specified by the value preceeding the “dot” symbol and in F#, it is specified as a last argument of 
  the function. The second example, which demonstrates projection is very similar. The only diference 
  is that the lambda function takes a number as an argument and returns also a number. The results are 
  collected into a list, so we get a list of numbers (<code>l2</code>) as a result. </p>

<h4>Processing lists in a pipeline</h4>

<p>In the previous examples, we wrote filtering and projection as two separate calls that took some 
  input and returned a collection as a result. This works fine, but it would be more elegant if we 
  could write this as a single operation without declaring an additional variable to store the 
  temporary result.</p>

<p>We can do this simply by “cutting” the first expression and “pasting” it in place of the temporary 
  variable (<code>l1</code>). As you can see in the following listing, the C# version already looks very readable, 
  but we’ll still have to do some improvements to the F# version:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="49%">
<pre lang="fsharp" style="width:100%">
&gt; map (fun n -&gt; n*2) 
      (filter (fun n -&gt; n%3 = 0) l)
  ;;

val it : int list = [6; 12; 18]
</pre></td><td width="49%"><pre lang="csharp" style="width:100%">
var it = 
  l.Where(l, n =&gt; n%3 == 0)
   .Select(n =&gt; n*2);

// result it: [6; 12; 18]
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>The C# version looks elegant, because we were already using extension methods that were added to C# 3.0
  exactly for this purpose. If you try to imagine how you’d write the same thing using ordinary 
  static methods like <code>Utils.Where</code>, you’ll see that it would be similarly confusing as our current F# 
  version. </p>

<p>One of the advantages of using extension methods in C# is that we can write the method calls in the 
  order in which they are executed (first <code>Where</code> – filtering and then <code>Select</code> – projection). In the 
  previous F# version the operations were written in a reverse order. Of course, F# offers a solution 
  for this problem. The solution is to use pipelining operator (written as <code>|&gt;</code>), which allows us to 
  write a sequence of operations:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; l |&gt; filter (fun n -&gt; n%3 = 0) 
    |&gt; map (fun n -&gt; n*2)
  ;;
val it : int list = [6; 12; 18]
</pre>

<p>Using the query operator, we get a similar structure of the code as we had in the previous C# 3.0 
  version using extension methods. The pipelining operator is a binary operator and its meaning is that 
  the value on the left side is used as an argument to the function on the right side. Thanks to the 
  associativity rules, the operations are performed in a sequence, meaning that the first operator 
  (preceding <code>filter</code>) is executed before the second one (preceding <code>map</code>).</p>

<p>In F#, it is possible to define custom operators and pipelining operator is something that you could 
  very simply implement on your own. It is however extremely useful, so it is part of the standard F# 
  library. As you probably know, custom operators cannot be declared in C#, but extension methods 
  provide often an interesting alternative. As this example demonstrated, we can get very similar 
  result by using extension methods (<code>Where</code>, <code>Select</code>) in C# and pipelining operator (<code>|&gt;</code>) in F#.</p>

<h4>Embedded query language</h4>

<p>To close our short excursion to the world of data collections, we should also look at query 
  expressions that are available in C# 3.0 and let us write a query like the previous in a form that is 
  syntactically similar to SQL. You should however keep in mind that this is just a syntactic sugar and 
  the code is translated to exactly the same code as we’ve used in the last example:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
var it = 
    from n in l
    where n % 3 == 0
    select n * 2;
</pre>

<p>F# has a more general feature that can be used for writing computations like this, which is called 
  sequence expression. The interesting thing is, that in F# this is a more general language feature
  (the generalized version is called computation expressions). This means that you can use it not only 
  for working with lists (let’s call these list computations), but also for other kinds of computations.
  One interesting example that is further described in our book is using computation expressions for 
  writing code that executes asynchronously (e.g. when downloading data from internet using HTTP requests).</p>

<p>I’ll not demonstrate sequence expressions here, but there is still one thing that I’d like to show you.
  There is one interesting option for making the previous F# code even more compact and that is using 
  partial application (or currying), which I shortly introduced earlier:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
l |&gt; filter (fun n -&gt; n%3 = 0) 
  |&gt; map ((*) 2)
</pre>

<p>You can see that we did a change to the second line and instead of using lambda function as a 
  parameter we used an expression <code>((*) 2)</code>. What does this code represent? Well, asterisk is an 
  operator for multiplication, so if we had a function <code>mul</code> that multiplies two numbers, the expression 
  would mean the same thing as: <code>(mul 2)</code>. Here, we’re getting back to partial application – the function 
  <code>mul</code> takes two numbers and returns their product. In this code, we give it only a single argument, so 
  it instead creates a function that takes a number as an argument and multiplies it by two. This means 
  that we get exactly the same functionality as earlier. If you’re still a bit confused by partial 
  application, you can imagine that the compiler automatically inserts a function that takes the second 
  argument for the <code>mul</code> function. The code with this modification would be (<code>fun n -&gt; mul 2 n</code>), which is 
  exactly what we wrote earlier.</p>

<h3>3.3&#160;&#160;Generics in .NET 2.0 and type inference in C# 3.0 and F#</h3>

<p>In the previous section we looked at working with lists and we’ve seen several examples of using F# 
  functions and C# extension methods for working with collections. In particular, we examined <code>filter</code> 
  (and C# equivalent <code>Where</code>) and <code>map</code> (<code>Select</code> in C#). </p>

<p>One thing that is extremely interesting about these methods is that they work with any type of list 
  or collection. This means that we can use the same function for filtering a list of strings as well 
  as a list of integers, floating point numbers or for example types representing products. The 
  mechanism that makes this possible is called generics and is available in C# since version 2.0. In F# 
  this mechanism is essential for writing any real-world piece of code.</p>

<p>In functional programming the type signatures of a function (especially if the function is generic) 
  serve as a very useful hint when writing the code. In the next few paragraphs I’d like to show how 
  you can “read” the type signature and use it for understanding what the function does and functions 
  for working with collections are excellent example for this. Let’s first look at declarations of the C#
  extension methods that we were using:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Filters elements of ‘source’ based on ‘predicate’
IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Where&lt;T&gt;(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; source, Func&lt;T, bool&gt; predicate);

// Projects each element in a sequence ‘source’ into a new form using ‘selector’
IEnumerable&lt;R&gt; Select&lt;S, R&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;S&gt; source, Func&lt;S, R&gt; selector);
</pre>

<p>The first method has a single type parameter (called <code>T</code>), which represents the type of elements in the 
  collection to be filtered. This means that the type parameter is used in the type of the first 
  parameter (<code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>). The second parameter represents a function which takes a value of type <code>T</code> 
  as an argument and returns a <code>bool</code> and is used as a predicate when filtering the elements. </p>

<p>You may already know that when you call a generic method as we did in previous examples, the type 
  parameter is replaced with the actual type (in our examples the actual type was <code>int</code>). This can be 
  either done explicitly by writing <code>Where&lt;int&gt;(...)</code>. In this case we just write the type that should be 
  used instead of the type parameter. However, C# is sometimes able to infer the type of the type 
  parameter, so we don’t actually need to write it. That’s how all our previous examples worked. We 
  simply wrote <code>Where(src, f)</code> (where <code>src</code> and <code>f</code> were some expressions with a known type) and C# compiler 
  used the type of <code>src</code> and <code>f</code> to deduce the type for the type parameter. This mechanism for deducing 
  types based on the context is called type inference and I already shortly talked about it when we 
  were looking at F# “Hello world” examples.</p>

<p>Let’s now look at the signatures of <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> functions in F#. We can do this simply by entering 
  the names of the functions in the F# interactive. This is because a function is also a value in F# 
  (it is a value of type function) and when we enter any value in the F# interactive, it prints its 
  type and the value. A function is just some compiled code, so it cannot be reasonably printed, but 
  we’re interested in the type:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; List.filter;;
val it : (('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list) = &lt;...&gt;
&gt; List.map;;
val it : (('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'b list) = &lt;...&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this example, I entered the full name of the function including a module name. In our discussion 
  of C# versions, I talked about <code>Where</code> (equivalent to <code>filter</code>), so this time, I’ll focus on the second 
  one. In the C# version a method for projection had two type parameters. It was declared as <code>Select&lt;S, R&gt;</code>,
  where <code>S</code> was a type of the elements in the source collection and <code>R</code> was a type of the elements in the 
  resulting collection.</p>

<p>To distinguish between ordinary types and type parameters, F# uses slightly different syntax, so if 
  you look at the signature of map, you can see two type parameters: <code>'a</code> representing the source type 
  and <code>'b</code> representing the result type. F# also allows different syntax for instantiation of generic 
  types (that is specifying the type for generic types), so <code>'a list</code> means exactly the same thing as 
  <code>list&lt;'a&gt;</code>. The following diagram shows in detail what the signature means:</p>

<div style="text-align:center; margin:15px;">
<img src="/articles/functional-overview/hedgehog.png" alt="Type signature"/>
</div>

<p>If you think about the type, you can easily come to conclusion what the function does. It takes a 
  list containing some values of type <code>'a</code>. The code is generic, which means that it doesn’t know 
  anything about this type and without any other argument it wouldn’t be able to do anything with a 
  value of this type. However, another argument specifies a function that can transform a value of type 
  <code>'a</code> into a value of type <code>'b</code>. This suggests that the function could iterate over all elements (of type 
  <code>'a</code>) in the list and transform all of them into values of type <code>'b</code>. Finally, we also know that it 
  returns a list containing elements of type <code>'b</code>, so we can easily guess that the function performs 
  projection. This kind of reasoning is often very useful, because it makes reading functional code 
  very easy. You can apply similar reasoning to <code>filter</code> as well and you’ll see that the only thing it 
  can do is to test whether every element in a list should be contained in the result using the specified predicate.</p>

<h4>Automatic generalization</h4>

<p>The most important difference between generics in C# and similar mechanism in F# is that in F# 
  you don’t have to explicitly say that the method is generic when you write it. You can do it, 
  but in most of the cases you don’t have to, because the compiler makes it generic automatically. 
  This is topic that would require much more space, but it is very important, so I’d like to 
  quickly introduce it. </p>

<p>Let’s look at a very simple C# implementation of <code>Map</code> method. The following code works with 
  <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, so it is different from the previous examples, where we were working with LINQ methods 
  that take general <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> type. Nevertheless, it is a good example for demonstrating 
  automatic generalization in F#:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
List&lt;R&gt; Map&lt;S, R&gt;(Func&lt;S, R&gt; f, List&lt;S&gt; source) {
    List&lt;R&gt; res = new List&lt;R&gt;();
    foreach (S el in source) 
        res.Add(f(el));
    return res;
}
</pre>

<p>As you can see, we explicitly defined two generic type parameters (<code>S</code> and <code>R</code>) and used them in 
  the method header (for defining types of arguments <code>f</code> and <code>source</code>) and also in the body (when 
  declaring <code>res</code> and in the <code>foreach</code> loop). I will not show how the code looks in F#, because we 
  haven’t seen any examples of functions working with lists (this is unfortunately out of the 
  scope of this article), but I’ll demonstrate how we could write this in a non-existent 
  functional pseudo-C# language. First, I’d like to shortly recapitulate one new feature in 
  C# 3.0 – a new keyword <code>var</code>, which can be used for declaring local variables in a method body:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
var n = 10;
</pre>

<p>The <code>var</code> keyword simply instructs the compiler to look at the expression assigned to the 
  variable and infer the type of the expression. In our case, the expression is a constant of 
  type <code>int</code>. The compiler then uses the type as a type of the variable (in our case <code>n</code>). This means 
  that the variable will be ordinary, statically-typed variable (or type <code>int</code> in our example), but 
  we don’t have to write the type explicitly. In C#, this feature is called type-inference.
  In the pseudo-C# language that I made up to demonstrate automatic generalization, you can use 
  <code>var</code> almost anywhere, where a type is expected, so you can write the following code:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
var Filter(var f, List&lt;var&gt; source) {
    var res = new List&lt;var&gt;();
    foreach (var el in source) 
        res.Add(f(el));
    return res;
}
</pre>

<p>The compiler for pseudo-C# has to be quite smart – at the beginning it only knows that source 
  is a list containing elements of some unknown type. The compiler could assign it some name, for 
  example <code>T1</code>. Then it also knows that the <code>foreach</code> loop iterates over all elements in the <code>source</code>, 
  so the type of <code>el</code> should be also <code>T1</code>. Next, it sees that we’re using the argument <code>f</code> as if it 
  were a function and that we’re adding the returned values to a list <code>res</code> (containing elements of 
  some unknown type). From this, it infers that <code>f</code> is a function taking <code>T1</code> and returning something 
  (let’s assign it a name <code>T2</code>), so it has to be of a type <code>Func&lt;T1, T2&gt;</code>. Similarly, we now know 
  that <code>res</code> is of type <code>List&lt;T2&gt;</code> and also that the return type of <code>Filter</code> is <code>List&lt;T2&gt;</code>. Because there 
  are two newly named types (<code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code>), the compiler now know that the method is generic and has 
  two type parameters.</p>

<p>This kind of reasoning is just a much more advanced variant of type-inference and is used in 
  many functional languages including F#. Thanks to the different syntax of F# language, the code 
  doesn’t look as odd as the code in the pseudo-C# (with <code>var</code> keyword almost everywhere). In F#, 
  you just don’t have to write the types if you don’t want to change the type automatically 
  inferred by the compiler. The type inference mechanism not only makes the code more generic 
  automatically, but also often helps to catch a mistake. If the inferred signature is different 
  from what you’d expect, you can see that there is something wrong with the code.</p>

<h2>4&#160;&#160;Functional architecture</h2>

<p>In this last section, I’d like to shortly talk about architectural aspects of functional 
  programming. This would of course require an entire article (more likely even a longer book 
  than our Real-world Functional Programming), but I’d like to conclude this article with a short 
  look from a high level – to balance the low level look from the previous sections where I was 
  talking mostly about language features. </p>

<h3>4.1&#160;&#160;Immutable data structures and parallelism</h3>

<p>The first thing that you learn when using functional programming is that you start the 
  development of any functional program by thinking about the structure of the data that the 
  program uses. For example, when developing a game, you don’t think about the objects that are 
  in the game and about the functionality that each object provides. You think about the data 
  structure that could represent the world, structure that could represent the characters in the 
  game and so on. Please, keep in mind that this is a very simplistic example and it doesn’t 
  cover all the complexity of a real-world development. It is however advanced enough to show 
  some important aspects of functional programming, which is exactly a reason why I’m discussing 
  it in this section.</p>

<p>We didn’t talk about common functional data structures in this article, but you can find a good 
  overview in my article [<a href="#fpgpref">4</a>]. Of course, an entire section of our book focuses on the problem of 
  structuring functional programs. However, we did introduce one functional data structure in 
  this article and that is list, so we can for example imagine that in a game, we have a list 
  storing information about all characters in a game:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; // Stores information about computer controlled agents in the game
  type GameCharacter = ... 

&gt; // List with all characters currently in the game
  let characters = [ ... ]
val characters : GameCharacter list
</pre>

<p>There is some type called <code>GameCharacter</code> that represents a single AI character controlled by the 
  computer. This type would store all the necessary information about the character. Next, we 
  have a list containing all the characters. This list would be probably a part of some type 
  representing the whole virtual world, but in our simple example, we’ll just work with this list.
  The next thing to do is to define functions for working with <code>GameCharacter</code> type. Simplest 
  functions that we may need are a function to update the character – that is to perform a single 
  step in the game, like moving the character, and a function that tests whether the character is 
  still alive (or whether it died for some reason during the last update):</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; // Calculates a new position, etc. of the character
  let updateCharacter ch = ...
val updateCharacter : GameCharacter -&gt; GameCharacter 
&gt; // Tests whether the character is alive
  let isCharacterAlive ch = ...
val isCharacterAlive : GameCharacter -&gt; bool
</pre>

<p>Now that we have the data structures that represent our game and several basic functions that 
  define operations on them, we can write an elementary step in our game. We’ll write a function 
  <code>updateCharacters</code> that takes a list of game characters, performs update on each of them and 
  removes all characters that died during the update. Since we’re using a list as a data 
  structure to store our characters, we can of course use previously discussed functions for 
  working with lists:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; // Updates all characters and removes those who died during the last update
  let updateCharacters characters = 
    characters
        |&gt; map updateCharacter
        |&gt; filter isCharacterAlive
val updateCharacters : GameCharacter list -&gt; GameCharacter list
</pre>

<p>The data structure to store characters is immutable, so the <code>updateCharacters</code> function takes a 
  list with characters (representing the current state) and returns a new list without modifying 
  the original one. This approach has several important benefits. First of all, it is much easier 
  to understand what the code really does – if you see a function that takes a list of characters 
  and returns a list of characters, you can safely assume that it doesn’t modify any other part 
  of the world than the characters. In the previous example it is also guaranteed that the 
  <code>updateCharacter</code> doesn’t do anything else then just calculating a new state of the character 
  from the previous one. It might read some properties of the state stored globally, but it 
  cannot alter it. As we’ll see in the next few paragraphs this is an extremely useful property 
  for dealing with recent trends in the computing industry, such as multi-core processors and 
  multi-processor systems.</p>

<h4>Parallelization of functional programs</h4>

<p>Let’s now imagine that we want to make the previous code multi-threaded. Updating the state of 
  the character may be an expensive operation (especially if it involves some AI), so we’d like 
  to use multiple threads to calculating new state of the characters. It turns out that doing 
  change like this is astonishingly simple: </p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
let updateCharacters characters = 
    characters 
        |&gt; parallelMap updateCharacter
        |&gt; parallelFilter isCharacterAlive
</pre>

<p>In this example, we just changed call to <code>map</code> with a <code>parallelMap</code> and similarly replaced <code>filter</code> 
  with <code>parallelFilter</code>. These new parallel functions do exactly the same thing as their non-
  parallel versions, but their implementation is more advanced and performs the operation on 
  multiple threads instead of doing it sequentially. </p>

<p>How is it possible that adding multi-threading is that simple in this example, while doing 
  similar thing in imperative object-oriented code is difficult? The first key difference is that 
  the functional program we’ve written is very declarative – it separates the functionality that 
  knows how to process a list into high-order functions (<code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>) and the user code just 
  defines what should be done with the list (<code>updateCharacter</code> and <code>isCharacterAlive</code> in our example).
  The second key feature is that we use immutable data structures, so changing the code from 
  sequential to parallel cannot introduce any race conditions. I’ll talk about this in a more 
  detail shortly.</p>

<p>Currently, functions like <code>parallelMap</code> and <code>parallelFilter</code> are not part of the standard .NET or F# 
  library, but with the upcoming Microsoft Parallel Extensions to .NET [<a href="#fpgpref">5</a>] these will be 
  available for LINQ and there will be bindings for F# as well. In the meantime you can either 
  download a preview version or implement these functions on your own (for more information you 
  can refer to my earlier article [<a href="#fpgpref">6</a>]).  </p>

<p>Using the preview of Parallel Extensions to .NET we can write the same thing in C#. Assuming 
  that we have a list of characters and methods <code>UpdateCharacter</code> and <code>IsCharacterAlive</code>, we can 
  rewrite the previous F# code to C# as follows:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
List&lt;GameCharacter&gt; UpdateCharacters(List&lt;GameCharacter&gt; characters) {
    return characters
            .AsParallel()
            .Select(UpdateCharacter)
            .Where(IsCharacterAlive);
}
</pre>

<p>Without the call to <code>AsParallel</code> method, it would look like an ordinary code for working with 
  collections from our earlier examples. The <code>AsParallel</code> method, which comes from the Parallel 
  Extensions library, hides a surprising complexity and as we can see, it exposes it in a very 
  simple way. It changes a type of the collection that we’re working and provides a new 
  implementation of Select and Where for this type. This means, that similarly as in the F# 
  example, the code is using a different version of these methods that define how to work with 
  collections.  The implementation used in this example thanks to <code>AsParallel</code> uses multi-threading,
  so the processing is executed in parallel.</p>

<p>Of course, changing the code from a sequential version to parallel requires that 
  <code>UpdateCharacter</code> and <code>IsCharacterAlive</code> don’t modify any global state in an inconsistent way. If 
  the code relied on the fact that it is executed sequentially, adding <code>AsParallel</code> would break it. 
  In functional languages, this is not a big problem, because the data structures are usually 
  immutable, but in C# you need to be more careful. Even though, C# doesn’t directly support 
  writing immutable data structures, you can implement many types in a functional way, which 
  makes it possible to safely use this technique for making code multi-threaded. For more 
  information about implementing functional data structures in C#, you can refer to a series of 
  articles by Eric Lippert [<a href="#fpgpref">7</a>].</p>

<p>This example nicely demonstrates how architectural ideas from functional programming influenced 
  technologies that are being currently developed to deal with issues like multi-threaded 
  development such as Parallel Extensions to .NET. There are of course other technologies 
  influenced by functional programming, but concurrent and asynchronous programming is very 
  important nowadays, so these examples show why functional programming matters for a real-world 
  developers. </p>

<h3>4.2&#160;&#160;Programs as languages</h3>

<p>So far, we’ve discussed how functional programs are structured. I wrote that developing of 
  functional program starts by designing the data structures and by designing operations that 
  work on top of these structures. In this section, I’ll shortly talk about different way of 
  thinking about functional programs and especially functional libraries.</p>

<p>Based on the earlier examples of F# you could see that the language has a minimum of predefined 
  constructs. For example, we’ve seen that the same keyword <code>let</code> is used for declaring local 
  values as well as for declaring functions. The rationale behind this is that a local value can 
  be treated as a function that doesn’t take any arguments – not surprisingly, this is the way 
  constants are usually defined in mathematics. </p>

<p>Thanks to the syntax of F# (and the same is true for many other functional languages as well) 
  it is possible to define many typical constructs not as a built-in language feature, but as a 
  custom operator or a library function. This means that you can implement a set of primitives 
  and use them to construct your programs. The programs will then look as if the primitives were 
  standard part of the language. We’ve already seen an example of this when working with lists – 
  the pipelining operator (<code>|&gt;</code>) is something that looks like a language feature, but it is just an 
  ordinary F# operator. </p>

<h4>Functional animations</h4>

<p>Let’s now look at a more advanced example that shows what this means in practice. The following 
  example demonstrates a “language” for describing animations in a functional way from Chapter 20 
  of our book:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
let solarSystem = 
  sun
    -- (rotate 80.00f 4.1f mercury)      
    -- (rotate 150.0f 1.6f venus)        
    -- (rotate 215.0f 1.0f 
           (earth -- (rotate 20.0f 12.0f moon)))    
</pre>

<a href="/articles/functional-overview/planets.png"><img src="/articles/functional-overview/planets_sm.png" style="border-style:none;margin:15px;float:right" alt="Solar system simulation"/></a>

<p>Even without knowing anything about F#, you could probably see what the program describes. It 
  defines our solar system with the first three planets (Mercury, Venus and Earth with Moon) and 
  defines how the cosmic objects rotate round each other. If you think about the code for a while,
  you can see that Moon rotates around the Earth and Earth, together with two other planets, 
  rotates around the Sun. The rotation is specified using two numbers and if you could play with 
  the program, you would quickly recognize that the first number specifies how far the planet is 
  from the center of rotation and the second specifies how fast it should rotate.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the most surprising fact about this example is that if you didn’t know that the 
  code is written in F#, you could think that it is written in some kind of simulation language. 
  You could think that <code>rotate</code> is a keyword of this language (that defines how things rotate 
  around each other) and that <code>--</code> is some connector used in simulations. In fact, <code>rotate</code> is 
  ordinary F# function and <code>--</code> is a custom operator.</p>

<h4>Language for working with lists</h4>

<p>We can apply the same thinking to our earlier examples of working with lists. In the example 
  with planets, the language defined two primitives – a <code>rotate</code> function and an operator <code>--</code> for 
  describing connections. The code that we implemented using these primitives is a model of an 
  animation. In our case <code>solarSystem</code> is a model of an animation of our solar system. The language 
  also knows how to execute the models. In the example with animations, executing a model means 
  drawing the animation on a form.</p>

<p>In the examples for working with lists, we’re modeling transformations of lists. The primitives 
  that are available to us are pipelining operator (<code>|&gt;</code>) and basic functions for list 
  manipulations (<code>filter</code>, <code>map</code> and many others). The transformation is described by parameterizing 
  these basic functions (e.g. by specifying what items from the list should be filtered) and 
  composition of the parameterized functions. We can for example model a transformation that 
  takes a collection of customers, filters those who live in London and returns a collection of 
  their names:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
let res = 
  customers 
    |&gt; filter (fun cust -&gt; cust.City = "London") 
    |&gt; map (fun cust -&gt; cust.Name)
</pre>

<p>The code is very similar to our earlier examples for working with lists. This is because we’re 
  using the same language for solving the problem. One more important note about this approach is 
  that once a developer learns the language, he or she can very easily read and write code that 
  solves problems for the problem domain for which the language was designed.</p>

<p>The last topic that I’d like to shortly discuss is how the models can be executed. In some 
  situations it is desirable to provide more ways for executing the problems implemented using a 
  same “language”. Actually, we’ve already discussed this when talking about parallelization, 
  because one possible alternative is to execute the transformation in parallel. Another 
  alternative way is to execute it as an SQL query using a database engine. The following example 
  shows how we could implement these two alternatives in F#:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// Executing a ‘query’ on in-memory data in parallel
let res = 
  customers 
    |&gt; parallelFilter (fun cust -&gt; cust.City = "London") 
    |&gt; parallelMap (fun cust -&gt; cust.Name)

// Executing a ‘query’ on database by translating it to SQL
let res = 
  SQL &lt;@@ %db.Customers 
           |&gt; filter (fun cust -&gt; cust.City = "London") 
           |&gt; map (fun cust -&gt; cust.Name) @@&gt;
</pre>

<p>The first example uses <code>parallelFilter</code> and <code>parallelMap</code> primitives that we already discussed. The 
  second uses F# quotations, which provide a way for supplying a completely different execution 
  method for a piece of F# code. In this case, the <code>SQL</code> function takes the F# code enclosed 
  between <code>&lt;@@</code> and <code>@@&gt;</code>, translates it to SQL code and executes it as a database query. This example 
  shows just the basic concept and you can find more information about quotations and F# 
  integration with LINQ that allows this online (more on quotations can be found in [<a href="#fpgpref">4</a>], examples 
  of real-world database queries in F# in [<a href="#fpgpref">8</a>]).</p>

<h4>Domain specific languages</h4>

<p>The approach to define some basic constructs is very popular and powerful. In context of F# it 
  is called language oriented programming and these languages are called DSLs (domain specific 
  languages) by some architects. This indicates that we’re defining a language for some problem 
  domain and this language gives us a vocabulary and in some sense also grammatical rules for 
  constructing our models.  Of course, there are techniques for implementing DSLs in other 
  programming paradigms, so the term can be for example used in OOP as well. However, as you 
  could see, the flexibility of functional languages makes it possible to define a very succinct 
  and expressive “language”.</p>

<p>Thanks to the vocabulary and grammar rules it can be often used even by those who understand 
  the problem domain, but are not experts in functional programming. This means that those who 
  use the DSL can be a distinct people from those who design it and develop it. Indeed, there are 
  different requirements for people in both groups – the designers should be more advanced 
  functional developers, whereas for the users, it is more important to well understand the 
  problem domain.</p>

<h2>5&#160;&#160;Summary</h2>

<p>In this greenpaper I wanted to show you some of the wonders of functional programming. Indeed, we didn’t
  have a space to look at more than a few selected topics and we couldn’t look at everything in 
  detail, but I hope that the article convinced you that functional programming is an interesting and 
  elegant paradigm, but also that it is very useful and can solve real-world problems as well as deal 
  with current trends in the IT industry. Problems that can be nicely solved using functional 
  programming include development for multi-core systems and the need to write the code in a more 
  declarative and expressive way. </p>

<p>In this article we started with discussing the general concepts that are important for functional 
  programming. We’ve seen that functional programs usually work with immutable declarations, how to use 
  recursion as a primary control structure. We also looked at functions and how they can be used as 
  arguments for other functions (or methods in C#) and how functional programs avoid side-effects (that 
  is modifying a global program state).</p>

<p>Next we’ve looked shortly at the F# language by demonstrating several “Hello world” examples and we 
  demonstrated some of the functional concepts in F# and how a similar thing can be achieved in C#. We’ve
  looked at recursion, <code>Func</code> delegate in C# and functions in F#.</p>

<p>Finally we’ve discussed functional programming from an architectural point of view. I wrote that when 
  developing functional programs, we first think about the data structures and operations that 
  transform or analyze these structures and we’ve also seen that using immutable data structures is 
  extremely useful for parallelizing the code. We also looked at language oriented development in F#. 
  In particular we’ve seen that functions for working with lists can be viewed as a “language” with a 
  vocabulary and grammatical rules and I also shortly demonstrated another “language”, which can be 
  used for creating functional animations.</p>

<p>More information about functional programming in context of .NET can be found in my book <strong>Real-world 
  functional programming in .NET</strong>, which reveals more connections between functional programming and C# 3.0
  with LINQ as well as introduces the new functional F# language in a more detail.</p>

<h3>F# community web sites</h3>
<p>There are also many useful community resources on F# that are worth visiting if you’re interested in F#. 
  First of all, there is a F# community web site [A] with forums and blogs. There is also an F# wiki [B] and 
  various blogs on F# [C, D, E and F]. If you’re looking for examples that use F#, you can take a look at some 
  open-source F# projects [G and H]. </p>
