    <h1>Explicit speculative parallelism for Haskell's Par monad</h1>
<p>Haskell provides quite a few ways for writing parallel programs, but none of them is fully automatic.
  The programmer has to use some annotations or library to run computations in parallel <em>explicitly</em>. 
  The most recent paper (and library) for writing parallel programs follows the latter approach. You can find more
  information about the library in a paper by Simon Marlow et al. <a type="external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/parallel/monad-par.pdf">A
  monad for deterministic parallelism</a> [<a href="#spphm">1</a>] and it is also available on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-par" type="external">Hackage</a>.
  However, I'll explain all the important bits that I'll use in this article.</p>

<p>The library provides an explicit way for writing parallel programs using a <code>Par</code> monad. The library contains 
  constructs for spawning computations and sharing state using blocking variables. However, the whole programming model
  is fully deterministic. I believe that it is sometimes useful to lift the determinacy requirement.
  Some programs are deterministic, but the fact cannot be (easily) automatically verified. For example, say you have two functions
  <code>fib1</code> and <code>fib2</code>. They both give the same result, but each of them is more efficient
  than the other one on certain inputs. To calculate a Fibonacci number, the program could <em>speculatively</em> 
  try to evaluate both functions in parallel and return the result of the one that finishes first.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this cannot be safely implemented using a fully deterministic library. In this article, I'll show some
  examples where speculative parallelism can be useful and I'll talk about an extension to the <code>Par</code> monad
  that I implemented (available on <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.ParMonad">GitHub</a>). The extension allows 
  programmers to write <em>speculative computations</em>, provided that they manually verify that their code is 
  deterministic. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this section, I'll show a basic example that demonstrates how the <code>Par</code> monad works. I'll use a 
  contrived example of calculating Fibonacci numbers to keep things simple. You can find better examples in
  the <code>Par</code> monad <a href="https://github.com/simonmar/monad-par/tree/master/examples">examples repository</a>.
  The performance measurements that I'll include in this article are just for demonstration (executed 
  on Intel Core 2 Duo CPU). I'll also briefly introduce the <code>unamb</code> operator [<a href="#spphm">3</a>] designed by 
  <a href="http://conal.net/blog/" type="external">Conal Elliott</a>. This solves a very
  important problem, originally in Functional Reactive Programming [<a href="#spphm">2</a>], which is closely related to 
  <em>speculative computations</em>.</p>

<h3>Deterministic parallelism monad</h3>
<p>The parallelism wraps a computation inside a monad. A parallel version of a function that returns 
  <code>Int64</code> will have a return type <code>Par Int64</code>. The type represents a computation 
  that can be started (using the <code>runPar</code> function).</p>
  
<p>Here is a basic example:</p>

<pre lang="haskell">
-- Naive calculation of Fibonacci numbers
fib :: Int64 -&gt; Int64
fib x | x &lt; 1 = 1
fib x = fib (x-2) + fib (x-1)

-- Parallel version of the function
pfib :: Int64 -&gt; Par Int64
pfib n | n &lt; 25 = return (fib n)
pfib n = do 
  av &lt;- spawn (pfib (n - 1))
  b  &lt;- pfib (n - 2)  
  a  &lt;- get av
  return (a + b)
</pre>

<p>The <code>fib</code> function is a usual (non-parallel) function for calculating Fibonacci numbers. The 
  <code>pfib</code> function is a parallel version (as you can see from the type signature). When the argument
  is smaller than 25, it runs sequential <code>fib</code> to avoid generating too many small work items. 
  If the argument is sufficiently large, the function <em>spawns</em> a computation to calculate 
  <code>pfib (n-1)</code> in parallel. The type of the <code>spawn</code> function is:</p>
<pre lang="haskell">
spawn :: NFData a =&gt; Par a -&gt; Par (IVar a)
</pre>
<p>The <code>NFData</code> requirement specifies that it should be possible to fully evaluate the 
  data structure. The rest of the signature says that the function takes some computations and returns
  a variable (wrapped in <code>Par</code>) that will eventually contain the result of the 
  computation. When writing code in the <code>Par</code> monad, we can get a value from the variable
  using <code>get</code> function. The function blocks the computation until a value becomes
  available and has the following type:</p>
<pre lang="haskell">
get :: IVar a -&gt; Par a
</pre>
<p>Now it should be easy to understand the rest of the <code>pfib</code> body. It spawns one recursive
  computation (as a background task), then runs the second recursive call on the main thread and then
  waits until the background operation completes. Finally, it returns the sum of the results.</p>

<p>The following simple snippet shows how to run the two functions and it shows some approximate
  performance measurements:</p>
<pre lang="haskell">
main = do 
  -- Naive sequential fibonacci (1.8 sec)
  print $ fib 32
  -- Parallel version with 25 threshold (1.0 sec)
  print $ runPar $ pfib 32
</pre>
<p>When we have a value of type <code>Par a</code>, we can evaluate it (to get an <code>a</code> value)
  using the <code>runPar</code> function. When running the parallel function on dual-core machine,
  it gives you a slightly less than 2x speedup. For comparison, a version implemented using the
  <code>par</code> and <code>pseq</code> combinators (which is a lower-level parallelism mechanism
  in GHC) completes in approximately 0.95 seconds.</p>

<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that the programming model used by the <code>Par</code> monad is 
  very similar to the model used by <code>async</code> in F#. The <code>spawn</code> function 
  corresponds to <code>Async.StartChild</code> and the <code>runPar</code> does the same thing as
  <code>Async.RunSynchronously</code>.</p>

<h3>Unambiguous choice</h3>
<p>Before discussing the support for speculative programming, I'd like to shortly discuss the 
  <em>unambiguous choice</em> operator, which was created by <a href="http://conal.net/blog/" type="external">Conal Elliott</a>
  for his <a href="http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/">Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)</a> implementation, 
  but is also available as a <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unamb">separate package on Hackage</a>.</p>

<p>The operator is a function of type <code>a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>. It takes two arguments, starts
  evaluating them concurrently and returns a value that becomes available first.
  When using the operator, the programmer needs to make sure that the two arguments
  are <em>compatible</em>. This means that if they both finish evaluating, their 
  values are equal. Formally, the requirement looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"><em>compatible a b</em> = (<em>a</em> = &#8869;) | (<em>b</em> = &#8869;) | (<em>a</em> = <em>b</em>)</p>

<p>The operator can be used for two purposes. First, it can be used to deal with computations
  that do not terminate. For example, say you have an expression <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code>. When <code>b</code>
  is <code>False</code>, the result of the expression should be (logically) also <code>False</code>.
  However, when <code>a</code> doesn't terminate, the overall expression will also never
  yield a value, because it will start evaluating <code>a</code> first. Using <code>unamb</code>,
  you can write:</p>
<pre lang="haskell">
import Data.Unamb

c = unamb (a &amp;&amp; b) (b &amp;&amp; a)
</pre>
<p>This use clearly matches the compatibility requirement. When both arguments terminate, the
  result is same in both of the cases. However, the expression returns <code>False</code>
  even if <code>a</code> is non-terminating computation, because the second argument will 
  evaluate to <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>The second possible use of <code>unamb</code> is for simple <em>speculative evaluation</em>.
  I described a typical scenario earlier. We have two functions and one is faster for some of
  the inputs, but not for all of them. Using <code>unamb</code>, we can write the following 
  helper that takes two functions and returns the value that is produced first:</p>

<pre lang="haskell">
tryBoth :: (t -&gt; a) -&gt; (t -&gt; a) -&gt; t -&gt; a
tryBoth f1 f2 n = unamb (f1 n) (f2 n)
</pre>

<p>To demonstrate how the function works, I implemented a more clever function for calculating
  Fibonacci numbers (<code>ffib</code>), which counts from zero and keeps adding last two 
  generated numbers. If you want to play with it, you can find the complete source code at 
  the end of the article. The following example shows the results:</p>

<pre lang="haskell">
main = do
  -- Naive recursive implementation (~1.7 sec)
  print fib 32
  -- Efficient implementation (~0.01 sec)
  print ffib 32
  -- Tries evaluating result using both functions (~0.01 sec)
  tryBoth fib ffib 32 
</pre>

<p>In this example, we could just call <code>ffib</code>, because it will be always faster.
 However, that's not always the case. You might have a very fast function that almost always
 works, but sometimes fails and a backup function that is slow, but always works.
</p>

<p>The <code>unamb</code> operator doesn't break determinacy of code only when it is
  used properly. The programmer needs to make sure that the arguments are <em>compatible</em>.
  However, I believe that this kind of construct is very useful and I hope that the previous
  examples demonstrated that. In the rest of the article, I'll describe my extension that
  allows you to use similar concepts in the <code>Par</code> monad.</p>

<h2>Speculative parallelism for Par monad</h2>
<p>The extension (available on <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.ParMonad">GitHub</a>)
  adds support for explicit cancellation of computations. When starting a computation, you can 
  give it a <em>cancellation token</em>. The token can be later used (from another computation)
  to cancel the background task. The design of the extension is very similar to how cancellation
  works in F# asynchronous workflows and in Task Parallel Library (TPL) in .NET.</p>

<h3>Parallel unambiguous choice</h3>
<p>The support for cancellation is a low-level control structure and it is not expected that
  it will be used directly very often. However, you can use it to implement your own functions
  that provide higher-level of abstraction. For example, it is quite easy to implement 
  <code>unamb</code> operator for <code>Par a</code> values:</p>

<pre lang="haskell">
-- Unambiguous choice between two parallel computations
-- Assumes that computations p1 and p2 are compatible
punamb :: NFData a =&gt; Par a -&gt; Par a -&gt; Par a
punamb p1 p2 = do
  res &lt;- newBlocking
  ct1 &lt;- newCancelToken
  ct2 &lt;- newCancelToken
  forkWith ct1 (do
    a &lt;- p1; put res a; cancel ct2)
  forkWith ct2 (do
    a &lt;- p2; put res a; cancel ct1)
  v &lt;- get res
  return v
</pre>

<p>The type of the function specifies that the value returned by the function 
  can be fully evaluated, but it is equally easy to define a version that evaluates the 
  value to a head-strict form (using <code>put_</code> instead of <code>put</code>). 
  The body of the <code>punamb</code> first creates some object for implementing the synchronization. 
  It uses <code>newBlocking</code> to create a variable (of type <code>IVar a</code>) for storing the result. </p>
<p>A variable created using <code>newBlocking</code> behaves slightly differently than standard variables created
  using <code>new</code>. When you attempt to write a value to a standard variable for the second time, the 
  writing fails and causes an exception. However, variables created using <code>newBlocking</code> behave 
  differently - instead of causing an exception, the second write is just blocked (indefinitely) and the
  operation never completes. This makes it possible to implement a race between two computations.
  The next two values <code>ct1</code> and <code>ct2</code> are cancellation tokens that are later used
  to cancel running computations.</p>

<p>After the initialization, the body starts two background computations using the <code>forkWith</code> function.
  The function takes a <code>CancelToken</code> as the first argument and a computation of type <code>Par ()</code>
  as the second argument. When called (from the <code>Par</code>) monad, it starts the computation in 
  background and associates the cancellation token with it. This allows others to cancel the computation.</p>

<p>The two computations started using <code>forkWith</code> are quite simple. Each of them evaluates
  one of the <code>punamb</code>'s arguments, then attempts to cancel the other computation and
  stores the result to the <code>res</code> variable. In a typical case, one of the computations 
  completes first and canceles the other (which is still running). However, if both complete at the
  same time, then one wins the race and writes value to <code>res</code>. The other attempts to write
  the result, but gets blocked. The race doesn't affect determinism, as long as the two computations
  given as arguments to <code>punamb</code> are <em>compatible</em>.</p>

<p>The following snippet uses <code>punamb</code> to implement an example similar to the 
  earlier demonstration of <code>unamb</code>. The <code>pffib</code> function (not shown in this
  article) is a faster implementation of Fibonacci numbers embedded in the <code>Par</code> monad:</p>
<pre lang="haskell">
main = do
  -- Naive recursion using Par monad (~1.1 sec)
  print $ runPar $ pfib 32
  -- Efficient recursion using Par monad (~0.01 sec)
  print $ runPar $ pffib 32
  -- Tries evaluating both &amp; returns the first (~0.04 sec)
  print $ runPar $ punamb (pfib 32) (pffib 32)
</pre>
<p>As you would expect, the <code>punamb</code> operation behaves similarly to <code>unamb</code>.
  When given two computations, it finishes after the first one completes. The time is slightly larger,
  because the first computation (running in parallel) also occupies some of the resources.</p>

<p>You may be wondering how the cancellation works - at which point is a <code>Par</code> 
  computation cancelled when another computation calls <code>cancel</code>. The following
  section briefly explains how is the cancellation implemented in my modification of the package.</p>

<h3>How are computations cancelled?</h3>
<p>The cancellation for the <code>Par</code> monad is cooperative, which means that the 
  computations can be cancelled only when they are written in a particular way that permits
  cancellation. In particular, the <code>cancel</code> function will not be able to cancel a
  <code>Par</code> computation that is created by writing <code>return foo</code> (where 
  <code>foo</code> is some expression).</p>

<p>A computation can be cancelled at points when it performs some special computation in 
  the <code>Par</code> monad. Most importantly, this includes the monadic binding (as well as
  other special calls like forking). The <code>pfib</code> function (demonstrated above) 
  contains many such points. It can be cancelled when it tries to spawn a recursive call (in
  background), when it recursively calls itsef as well as when it tries to read the result
  of the background computation. </p>

<p>You can exlpore the source code of my modification on GitHub. The commit that adds the cancellation support 
  (<a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.ParMonad/commit/c35f7311e7b846aaf087f7604d1d84f247b20d4a">see here</a>)
  shows the difference compared with the original version. Implementing an un-cooperative 
  cancellation (as, for example, in <code>unamb</code>) would be also possible, but more
  difficult. However, I believe that the cooperative cancellation model works very well 
  for the <code>Par</code> monad, because parallel computations generally consist of 
  large number of small (atomic) steps.</p>

<p>To finish the blog post, the last section shows a single larger example of implementing
  tree processing as a <em>speculative computation</em> explicitly using cancellation.</p>

<h2>Speculative tree processing</h2>
<p>In this section, I present a larger example that uses the <em>cancellation</em> support to implement
  a speculative processing of a tree. We look how to implement a <code>forall</code> function that checks whether 
  a specified predicate holds for all leaves of the tree. When the function returns <code>False</code> for some
  value, the overall result will also be false. In this case, the function can cancel all parallel tasks and return 
  immediately.</p>

<p>The example uses the following simple tree structure:</p>

<pre lang="haskell">
data Tree a 
  = Leaf a
  | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)
</pre>

<p>The following snippet shows a basic parallel version of <code>forall</code>. It uses the same recursive
  parallel processing pattern that was used earlier in the <code>pfib</code> function:</p>

<pre lang="haskell">
-- Test whether all elements match the given predicate (in parallel)
forallp :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Par Bool
forallp p (Leaf num) = return $ p num
forallp p (Node left right) = do
  al' &lt;- spawn $ forallp p left
  ar  &lt;- forallp p right
  al  &lt;- get al'
  return (al &amp;&amp; ar)
</pre>

<p>When processing a leaf, the function calls the predicate and returns the result. When processing a node, 
  it spawns processing of the left sub-tree as a background operation (using <code>spawn</code>, which is 
  implemented using <code>fork</code>) and then processes the right sub-tree. After both operations 
  complete, it returns logical conjunction of the two results.</p>

<p>When implementing the speculative version, we need to spawn two background computations (to start
  processing the left and right sub-tree). When any of them completes returning <code>False</code>, we
  can immediately store the result in some variable, which unblocks the main computation (and it can 
  return the overall result). When the result is <code>False</code>, the process needs to wait until the
  other computation completes before it can set the final result.</p>

<p>The following snippet shows the speculative version:</p>
<pre lang="haskell">
-- Test whether all elements match the given predicate
-- (Speculatively - False is returned immediately)
foralls :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Par Bool
foralls p tree = do
    tok &lt;- newCancelToken
    r &lt;- forall' p tok tree
    cancel tok 
    return r
  where 
    -- Recursively start computations using the same cancellation token
    forall' p tok (Leaf v) = return (p v)
    forall' p tok (Node left right) = do
      leftRes &lt;- new
      rightRes &lt;- new
      finalRes &lt;- newBlocking
      forkWith tok (forall' p tok left &gt;&gt;= 
        completed leftRes rightRes finalRes)
      forkWith tok (forall' p tok right &gt;&gt;= 
        completed rightRes leftRes finalRes)
      get finalRes

    
    -- Called when one of the branches complete. Write result immediately
    -- if it is False, otherwise wait for the second computation.
    completed varA varB fin resA = do
      put varA resA
      if not resA then put fin False
      else get varB &gt;&gt;= put fin . (&amp;&amp; resA)
</pre>

<p>The main body of the function creates a new <code>CancelToken</code> and then calls a helper that does 
  the actual processing. The cancellation token is used when starting any background computations during the
  recursive processing. As a result, when the helper function returns <code>False</code> (meaning that some
  computations may be still running), we can cancel all (still running, but unnecessary) computations
  using this single token.</p>

<p>The function that implements the recursive processing first creates three variables. The first two
  (<code>leftRes</code> and <code>rightRes</code>) are used by their corresponding computations (when a 
  left computation completes, it writes result to <code>leftRes</code>). The last variable is created using
  the <code>newBlocking</code> function, because it can be accessed by any of the two computations. Its value
  is set to the final result as soon as possible. The function then spawns two tasks to process sub-trees
  and waits for the final result.</p>

<p>The two background computations spawned by the function both make a recursive call and then pass the
  result to the <code>completed</code> function. It takes all three variables (variable of the currently 
  completed computation, variable of the other computation and a final result variable) and the result
  of the computation. If the result is <code>False</code>, then it sets the final result. Otherwise, it
  waits until the other computation completes (by blocking on the other variable) and then sets the
  final result (in this case, the computation may race with the other call to <code>completed</code>,
  but that is not a problem - they both produce the same value and the second one will just block
  when it attempts to write).</p>

<p>The complete source code contains a full example that you can run to test the function. Assuming we have
  a tree value named <code>tree</code>, we can write the following test. It demonstrates the performance of a 
  simple sequential version, parallel version and a speculative version from the last listing:</p>
<pre lang="haskell">
main = do
  -- Binary tree contains ~270 large primes and a single
  -- non-prime number. The tree is fully evaluated.

  -- Single-threaded version (see source code link) (~3.7 sec)
  measure "Non-prime num (Seq) " (forall isPrime tree2)
  -- Simple parallel version (~1.9 sec)
  measure "Non-prime num (Par) " (runPar $ forallp isPrime tree2)
  -- Parallel version with shortcircuiting (~0.01 sec)
  measure "Non-prime num (Shr) " (runPar $ foralls isPrime tree2)
</pre>

<p>The example generates a tree containing large prime numbers and one number that is not a prime. 
  Then it ensures that the tree is fully evaluated and processes it using different techniques. 
  Parallel processing is roughly two times faster than sequential version, but a speculative
  version is faster by orders of magnitude. This is, of course, the case only when the tree contains
  at least one non-prime number. The performance depends on the data, but in general, the speculative 
  parallelism can be used to implement various useful heuristics.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, I demonstrated a couple of extensions that I implemented for the <code>Par</code>
  monad that has been recently proposed by Simon Marlow, Ryan Newton and Simon Peyton Jones. The 
  extension adds functions for cancellation of computations in the monad.</p>

<p>The support for cancellation should be viewed as a low-level mechanism. In practice, it can be 
  used to implement useful higher-level abstractions such as the <code>unamb</code> operator designed 
  by Conal Elliott. The operator provides a high-level way for writing speculative computations 
  (or working with partially undefined functions). When using the operator, the developer is 
  responsible for ensuring that the arguments are compatible (will give the same result). </p>

<p>In this article, I showed an implementation of <code>unamb</code> for the <code>Par</code> monad
  and also a larger tree-processing example. The tree processing example cannot be elegantly written
  using <code>unamb</code>, because it requires more expressive abstraction. This abstraction could be,
  for example, a Haskell version of <em>joinads</em> [<a href="#spphm">4</a>], a language extension that I designed with Don
  Syme during an internship at Microsoft Research. I'll write more about that in some future blog post...</p>
