    <h1>The theory behind covariance and contravariance in C# 4</h1>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/icon.png" title="Category theory is sometimes called 'general abstract nonsense', but it can actually be useful!" class="rdecor" />

<p>In C# 4.0, we can annotate generic type parameters with <code>out</code> and <code>in</code> annotations to 
specify whether they should behave <em>covariantly</em> or <em>contravariantly</em>. This is mainly
useful when using already defined standard interfaces. Covariance means that you can use
<code>IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;</code> in place where <code>IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;</code> is expected. Contravariance
allows you to pass <code>IComparable&lt;object&gt;</code> as an argument of a method taking <code>IComparable&lt;string&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So far, so good. If you already learned about covariance and contravariance in C# 4, then 
the above two examples are probably familiar. If you're new to the concepts, then 
the examples should make sense (after a bit of thinking, but I'll say more about them). 
However, there is still a number of questions. Is there some easy way to explain the 
two concepts? Why one option makes sense for some types and the other for different types? 
And why the hell is it called <em>covariance</em> and <em>contravariance</em> anyway?</p>

<p>In this blog post, I'll explain some of the mathematics that you can use to think 
about covariance and contravariance.</p>

<h2>Covariance and contravariance in C#</h2>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/oodiagram.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>Let's say that we have a hierarchy of classes as shown in the diagram on the right.
All types are subclasses of the .NET <code>object</code> type. Then we have <code>Animal</code> which has 
two subclasses <code>Cat</code> and <code>Fish</code> and finally, there is also some other .NET type <code>Random</code>.</p>

<h3>Covariance</h3>

<p>Let's start by looking what <em>covariance</em> means. Assuming that every <code>Animal</code>
has a <code>Name</code>, we can write the following function that prints names of all
animals in some collection:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">void PrintAnimals(IEnumerable&lt;Animal&gt; animals) {
  for(var animal in animals)
    Console.WriteLine(animal.Name);
}</pre>

<p>It is important to note that <code>IEnumerable&lt;Animal&gt;</code> can be only used to read <code>Animal</code>
values from the collection (using the <code>Current</code> property of <code>IEnumerator&lt;Animal&gt;</code>). There
is no way we could write <code>Animal</code> back to the collection - it is read-only. Now, if we
create a collection of cats, can we use <code>PrintAnimals</code> to print their names?</p>

<pre lang="csharp">IEnumerable&lt;Cat&gt; cats = new List&lt;Cat&gt; { new Cat(&quot;Troublemaker&quot;) };
PrintAnimals(cats);</pre>

<p>If you compile and run this sample, you'll see that the C# compiler accepts it and the
program runs fine. When calling <code>PrintAnimals</code>, the compiler uses <em>covariance</em> to convert
<code>IEnumerable&lt;Cat&gt;</code> to <code>IEnumerable&lt;Animal&gt;</code>. This is correct, because the <code>IEnumerable</code> 
interface is marked as <em>covariant</em> using the <code>out</code> annotation. When you run the program,
the <code>PrintAnimals</code> method cannot cause anything wrong, because it can only <em>read</em> animals
from the collection. Using a collection of cats as an argument is fine, because all 
cats are animals.</p>

<h3>Contravariance</h3>

<p><em>Contravariance</em> works the other way than <em>covariance</em>. Let's say we have a method that
creates some cats and compares them using a provided <code>IComparer&lt;Cat&gt;</code> object. In a more
realistic example, the method might, for example, sort the cats:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">void CompareCats(IComparer&lt;Cat&gt; comparer) {
  var cat1 = new Cat(&quot;Otto&quot;);
  var cat2 = new Cat(&quot;Troublemaker&quot;);
  if (comparer.Compare(cat2, cat1) &gt; 0) 
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Troublemaker wins!&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>The <code>comparer</code> object takes cats as arguments, but it never returns a cat as the result.
You could say that it is a write-only in the way in which it uses the generic type parameter.
Now, thanks to <em>contravariance</em>, we can create a comparer that can compare animals and
use it as an argument to <code>CompareCats</code>:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">IComparator&lt;Animal&gt; compareAnimals = new AnimalSizeComparator();
CompareCats(compareAnimals);</pre>

<p>The compiler accepts this code because the <code>IComparer</code> interface is <em>contravariant</em> and its
generic type parameter is marked with the <code>in</code> annotation. When you run the program, it
also makes sense. The <code>compareAnimals</code> object that we created knows how to compare animals
and so it can certainly also compare two cats. A problem would be if we could read a <code>Cat</code>
from <code>IComparer&lt;Cat&gt;</code> (because we couldn't get <code>Cat</code> from <code>IComparer&lt;Animal&gt;</code>!), but that
is not possible, because <code>IComparer</code> is write-only.</p>

<h2>Categories and classes</h2>

<p>Like surprisingly many other programming language concepts, the terms <em>covariance</em> and
<em>contravariance</em> come from an abstract branch of mathematics called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>.
Category theory has a reputation for being very abstract - in fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">the category theory wikipedia page</a> 
mentions that some call it "general abstract nonsense". The theory starts with a fairly
simple definition and then builds more and more abstractions on top of the previous layer, so
it is easy to lose track. However, we do not need to go very far to explain <em>covariance</em> and 
<em>contravariance</em>.</p>

<h3>Category of classes</h3>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/category.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>Let's take another look at the diagram that relates different classes in our example (beginning
of the previous section). We can read an arrow from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em> in the diagram as <em>it is possible 
to use A where B is expected</em>. For example, it is possible to use <code>Cat</code> where an <code>Animal</code> is 
expected and it is possible to use <code>Animal</code> where an <code>object</code> is expected.</p>

<p>To make the diagram complete, we need to add a couple of arrows (see the new version on the right).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, any class <em>A</em> can be used where a class <em>A</em> is expected (obviously!), so we 
need to add an arrow from each class to itself. These are showed as dotted lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, if we can use class <em>A</em> where <em>B</em> is expected and <em>B</em> where <em>C</em> is expected, then we
can also use <em>A</em> where <em>C</em> is expected. This means that if there is an arrow from <code>Cat</code> to
<code>Animal</code> and from <code>Animal</code> to <code>object</code>, we should also draw an arrow from <code>Cat</code> to <code>object</code>.
These are shown as dashed lines.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I described in this section is essentially what category theorists call a <em>category</em> - 
objects connected with arrows that satisfy the two properties above. Let's look at the 
definition more formally...</p>

<div style="margin:0px 30px 15px 30px; background:#f0f0f0; padding:10px 15px 5px 15px;">

<p><strong>Side-note.</strong> If you want to learn even more category theory, then note that the class
<code>object</code> is interesting, because there is exactly one arrow from every other class in the
hierarchy (any type can be used where <code>object</code> is expected). In category theory, this is
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_and_terminal_objects">terminal object</a>.</p>

</div>

<h3>Definition of category</h3>

<p>A <em>category</em> is defined as a set of <em>objects</em> together with <em>arrows</em> between them. You can 
visualize it as a diagram with dots or boxes (representing objects) and arrows between them.
We can compose arrows between objects, so if we have an arrow from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em> and an arrow
from <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>, there is also an arrow from <em>A</em> to <em>C</em> (which can be constructed from the
two arrows). In addition, there are two requirements about arrows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For every object <em>A</em>, there is an arrow from <em>A</em> to <em>A</em> 
(this is called <em>identity</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>If we have arrows <em>A -> B</em>, <em>B -> C</em> and <em>C -> D</em>, then composing
<em>A -> B</em> with <em>B -> C</em> and then composing the result with <em>C -> D</em> is
the same arrow as composing <em>B -> C</em> with <em>C -> D</em> first and then
adding <em>A -> B</em> at the beginning (this is called <em>associativity</em>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Category theory is very abstract, because it does not tell us anything about the objects and
arrows involved. They could be just <em>anything</em>. You can create a category by taking numbers and 
drawing arrow between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> if <em>a</em> is greater than or equal to <em>b</em>, but you can also create a 
category from classes and draw arrows where a class can be used in place of another.</p>

<h2>Functors and depth in hierarchy</h2>

<p>There is one more idea from category theory that we need to understand <em>covariance</em> and <em>contravariance</em>
and that is a <em>functor</em>. Let's say that we want to count the depth of the inheritance for objects in our
class hierarchy. For example, <code>object</code> has depth zero; <code>Animal</code> and <code>Random</code> both have a single parent
<code>object</code>. Finally, <code>Fish</code> and <code>Cat</code> both have depth two, since they have parent <code>Animal</code>, which has another
parent <code>object</code>.</p>

<p>We can draw this as a transformation from our category of classes to a category of numbers - that is,
a category with numbers 1, 2, 3, ... and an arrow between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> if <em>a >= b</em>:</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/functor.png" />
</div>

<p>To be completely precise, we need to map <em>objects</em> as well as <em>arrows</em> of the category.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For <strong>objects</strong> the mapping is as described above: <code>object</code> is mapped to 0; <code>Animal</code> and 
<code>Random</code> are mapped to 1; finally <code>Cat</code> and <code>Fish</code> are mapped to 2.</p></li>
<li><p>For <strong>arrows</strong> the mapping maps an arrow representing the inheritance relation to an 
arrow that "proves" that the parent is actually a parent (and shows how far in the hierarchy
it is). So, the arrows from <code>Cat</code> to <code>object</code> and from <code>Fish</code> to <code>object</code> are mapped to
the arrow <em>2 >= 0</em> (and so on). Identity arrows (i.e. from <code>Random</code> to <code>Random</code>) are mapped to
arrows <em>a >= a</em> (for <code>Random</code>, this is the arrow <em>1 >= 1</em>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the mapping has some interesting properties. All <em>identity</em> arrows on the left are 
mapped to the <em>identity</em> arrows on the right. Also, if we compose an arrow on the left (i.e. from
<code>Fish</code> to <code>Animal</code> with an arrow from <code>Animal</code> to <code>object</code>) and then map it, we get the same arrow
as if we first mapped the two arrows and then composed the result (arrow <em>2 >= 1</em> with an arrow 
<em>1 >= 0</em>, which composes to an arrow <em>2 >= 0</em>).</p>

<h3>Definition of a functor</h3>

<p>The mapping that we just described is exactly what category theorists call <em>functor</em>. To make
this blog post fancier, let's look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor">formal definition</a>. Assuming that we 
have two categories <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> (i.e. our classes and numbers) a functor <em>F</em> from <em>C</em> to <em>D</em> is
a mapping that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to each object from <em>C</em> assigns an object from <em>D</em>; if <em>A</em> is an object in <em>C</em>, we 
write <em>F(A)</em> for the assigned object in <em>D</em> (in our example, <em>F(Cat) = 2</em> and <em>F(object) = 0</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>to each arrow from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em> in category <em>C</em>, a functor assigns an arrow from <em>F(A)</em> to <em>F(B)</em>
in the category <em>D</em> (in our example, this is simple, because we only have a single arrow between
two numbers; in general there may be multiple arrows - to demonstrate the concept, given an
arrow from <code>Cat</code> to <code>Animal</code>, we assign it an arrow from 2 to 1, which is an arrow labelled
with <em>2 >= 1</em>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, two conditions must hold. Firstly, the arrow assigned to the identity arrow 
(arrow from <em>A</em> to <em>A</em> in category <em>C</em>) needs to be the identity arrow of the object <em>F(A)</em>. 
Secondly, if we compose arrows and then map the composed arrow, the result should be the 
same as if we first map the arrows and then compose the result. The two conditions are
exactly the same as the ones I mentioned at the end of the previous section. Although these
are important in theory, we don't need to worry about them (because I will not cheat and 
when I say that something is a functor, it will actually obey these two laws!)</p>

<h2>Functors and generic types</h2>

<p>So far, I explained what a <em>functor</em> is and we looked at an example - mapping from a category of
classes to a category of numbers that assigns the <em>depth</em> in a class hierarchy to every class.
The example was interesting, because it mapped more complex structure (tree of classes) to a 
flat structure (just ordered numbers). In general, functors can do fairly complicated things.
To explain <em>covariance</em> and <em>contravariance</em>, we need to look at pretty simple functors though.</p>

<h3>Covariant functors</h3>

<p>The definition of <em>functor</em> that I described earlier is actually a <em>covariant functor</em>. The
<em>covariant</em> label means that it keeps the same orientation of arrows when mapping them. To an
arrow <em>A -> B</em>, the functor assigns an arrow <em>F(A) -> F(B)</em>. So, how does this relate to 
covariant generic types?</p>

<p>We can understand <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> as a functor that takes classes such as <code>Cat</code> or <code>Animal</code> to
enumerable interfaces <code>IEnumerable&lt;Cat&gt;</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;Animal&gt;</code>, respectively:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/covariant.png" />
</div>

<p>The mapping between objects is quite simple. Given a type named <code>Cat</code>, the mapping gives us
back a type <code>IEnumerable&lt;Cat&gt;</code> (and similarly for all other types). The mapping of arrows is
also straightforward. If we have a type <code>Cat</code> that can be used in place of <code>Animal</code> (that is,
we have an arrow <em>Cat -> Animal</em>), then the arrow is mapped to an arrow between <code>IEnumerable&lt;Cat&gt;</code> and
<code>IEnumerable&lt;Animal&gt;</code>. This means that the mapping preserves orientation of arrows and so 
we can use <code>IEnumerable&lt;Cat&gt;</code> where an <code>IEnumerable&lt;Animal&gt;</code> is expected!</p>

<p>Okay, I bet you can already guess what is going to happen with the picture when we look at
contravariant generic types such as <code>IComparable</code>...</p>

<h3>Contravariant functors</h3>

<p>The definition of <em>functor</em> that I showed earlier is actually a definition of <em>covariant functor</em>, but
category theory also defines <em>contravariant functors</em>. The only difference is that <em>contravariant</em>
functor reverses the orientation of all arrows. So, if we have a contravariant functor <em>G</em> from 
category <em>C</em> to <em>D</em>, it means that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to each object from <em>C</em> assigns an object from <em>D</em> (same as previously)</p></li>
<li><p>to each arrow from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em> in category <em>C</em>, a functor assigns an arrow from <em>F(B)</em> to <em>F(A)</em>
in the category <em>D</em> (note that the arrow between <em>F(B)</em> and <em>F(A)</em> is now in the opposite
direction!)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let's look at an example. The <code>IComparer&lt;T&gt;</code> type is a <em>contravariant functor</em>. For objects,
the mapping is quite simple. Given <code>Animal</code>, the functor gives us a type <code>IComparer&lt;Animal&gt;</code>
(and similarly for other types). However, the mapping on arrows is interesting. If we have an arrow
from <code>Cat</code> to <code>Animal</code> (saying that <code>Cat</code> can be used where <code>Animal</code> is expected), the mapped 
arrow is reversed, so we get an arrow from <code>IComparer&lt;Animal&gt;</code> to <code>IComparer&lt;Cat&gt;</code>. This corresponds
to the C# example in the first section - we can use comparer on animals to compare cats.
The following diagram shows how <em>contravariant functor</em> reverses arrows in our category of classes:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/contravariant.png" />
</div>

<p>The diagram tells us some interesting things. By reversing the arrows, there is now an arrow
from <code>IComparer&lt;object&gt;</code> to any other <code>IComparer</code> in the diagram. This means that we can use
<code>IComparer&lt;object&gt;</code> to compare anything! (In the <em>covariant</em> case, any <code>IEnumerable</code> could have
been used as an argument to method taking <code>IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;</code>.) Also, there is no <em>terminal
object</em> so we cannot write a method that will take any <code>IComparer</code> as an argument. (This does not
really have any practical implications, but it is interesting nevertheless!)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>If you followed the article up to this point, then congratulations and thanks for staying with me! 
You learned quite a few concepts from <em>general abstract nonsense</em> branch of mathematics, but I hope
you could see that they nicely correspond to features in C# 4.0. We started by looking at the
definition of <em>category</em> and how it corresponds to class hierarchies (with classes as <em>objects</em>
and inheritance as <em>arrows</em>). Then we looked at <em>functors</em> and how <em>covariant functors</em> model
covariant generic types like <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> and <em>contravariant functors</em> model contravariant
types like <code>IComparer&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>Why category theory matters?</h3>

<p>This may be an interesting intelectual exercise, but why should we care? Firstly, I think that 
reading this article gives you a better intuition about <em>covariance</em> and <em>contravariance</em>, which 
are quite hard to understand concepts.</p>

<p>If you're just going to use C# 4, then you don't really need to worry about category theory. If you
do something wrong, the compiler will tell you (and will keep telling you until you get it right).
Luckilly, the C# language designers understood the theory for us! 
However, even if you're not designing a language, knowing the theory might help you understand 
complex C# code. For example, take a look at the following example:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">static void CallWithPrinter(Action&lt;Action&lt;Animal&gt;&gt; animalGenerator) {
  animalGenerator(animal =&gt; Console.WriteLine(animal.Name));
}</pre>

<p>The method takes an <code>Action</code> delegate (which is contravariant) that takes another <code>Action</code> delegate
as the input and does something. This nested delegate accepts any argument of type <code>Animal</code>. 
The method invokes the delegate and gives it a lambda function that takes an animal and prints its name.
Now, the question is, can we use <code>Action&lt;Action&lt;Cat&gt;&gt;</code> as an argument to <code>CallWithPrinter</code>?</p>

<pre lang="csharp">Action&lt;Action&lt;Cat&gt;&gt; catGenerator = handler =&gt; handler(new Cat(&quot;Otto&quot;));
CallWithPrinter(catGenerator);</pre>

<p>The sample creates a lambda function that takes a handler of type <code>Action&lt;Cat&gt;</code> and calls it with
a sample cat as an argument. If you try to write this code in C# 4, it will compile and run fine.
Why is that the case? Because we are applying <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> delegate two times and so we reverse
the arrows twice! See the following diagram:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;">
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/variance-explained/actions.png" />
</div>

<p>Understanding why the previous code snippet is correct just using the C# specification could be 
quite hard. The example is quite simple, so you might intuitively expect it to work (and hope that
the compiler agrees), but intuition can be sometimes tricky. Understanding the theory gives you a 
powerful tool that you can use to better understand what is going on, even in complicated situations
that combine covariant and contravariant types in crazy ways!</p>
