    <h1><span class="hm">Pop-up from Hell</span><span class="hs"> On the growing opacity of web programs</span></h1>
<p>I started to learn how to program in high school at the end of the 1990s using a mix of BASIC, Turbo
Pascal and HTML with JavaScript. The seed for this blog post comes from my experience with learning
how to program in JavaScript, without having much guidance or organized resources. This article continues
a theme that I started in my <a href="http://tomasp.net/commodore64">interactive Commodore 64 article</a>,
which is to look at past programming systems and see what interesting past ideas have been lost
in contemporary systems. Unlike with Commodore 64, which I first used in 2018 in the
Seattle Living Computers museum, my perspective on the Early Web may be biased by personal
experience. I will do my best to not make this post sound like a grumbling of an old nerd!
(I thought this only comes later, but I may have been wrong...)</p>
<div class="rdecor"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/popup-from-hell/close-me.gif" style="max-width:400px" /></div>
<p>The 1990s, the web had a fair amount of quirky web pages, often created just for fun. The GeoCities
hosting service, which has <a href="http://www.oocities.org">partly been archived</a> is a witness of this
and there are even academic books, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/2YiEUVe">Dot-Com Design</a> documenting
this history.</p>
<p>Some of the quirky things that you could do with JavaScript included creating roll-over effects
(making an image change when mouse pointer is over it), creating an animation that follows the
cursor as it moves and, of course, annoying the users with all sorts of pop-up windows for both
entertaining and advertising purposes. Annoying pop-ups will be the starting point for my blog
post, but I'll be using those to make a more general and interesting point about how programs
evolve to become more opaque.</p>
<p><em>This blog post is based on a talk <a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/Talks/2021/popup-from-hell/">Popup from hell: Reflections on the most annoying 1990s
program</a> that I did recently at an
(in person!) meeting of the <a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/">PROGRAMme project</a>. Thanks to
everyone who attended for lively discussion and useful feedback!</em></p>
<h2>Pop-ups and the Internet's original sin</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell, the necessary technical components for the most annoying pop-up that I will
cover in this blog post have been in place since 1995 when JavaScript was first introduced
in Netscape Navigator 2.0. The library of standard JavaScript functions included
the <code>window.open</code> and also <code>window.onbeforeunload</code> from the very start. There was nothing evil
about opening new windows in your web applications. After all, many regular desktop applications
still open new windows when you open a detailed view or start writing a new email.</p>

<br />
<img src="watch.png" style="width:100%;" />
<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> "Pop-up" advertisement from the 2020s</p>
</div>
<p>As told in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/">The Internet's Original Sin</a>,
the first use of <code>window.open</code> for advertising was probably at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod.com">Tripod.com</a>
web hosting site, which used it to disassociate the advertisements from the (potentially
not-safe-for-work) content hosted on the site by its users.</p>
<p>Since then, pop-ups became <em>"one of the most hated tools in the advertiser's toolkit."</em>
The early web allowed opening pop-ups whenever a web page wanted. You could successfully
invoke <code>window.open</code> when a web page was loading. By changing the focus, the web page could
also make the pop-up appear underneath the main browser window, so that the user would only
see it once they close the browser. This technique is apparently known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_ad">pop-under
ads</a>. Another annoying trick was to open the advertisement
when the user left a page, by handling the <code>window.onbeforeunload</code> event that was triggered
when the user closed the window or when they navigated somewhere else.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, web browsers started fighting back by blocking pop-ups. A simple option
was to block all <code>window.open</code> calls and notify the user. More sophisticated blockers block
pop-ups only when loading or unloading, but allowed them, for example, in response to a button
click.</p>
<p>Pop-up blockers did not stop the pop-up ad war for long. So called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_ad">hover ads</a>,
or in-page pop-ups, recreate the annoying pop-up experience by simulating a pop-up window
inside the page itself. A pop-up blocker cannot detect this, because the pop-up is not created
using some easily identifiable system functionality like <code>window.open</code>, but using standard
HTML elements with some innocently-looking JavaScript to display the element.</p>
<p>In other words, we got from annoying pop-up ads in the 1990s, like the one in Figure 1, to
equally annoying in-page pop-up ads in the 2020s, like the one in Figure 2.</p>
<h2>Pop-ups and the quirky social web</h2>
<p>When I was learning to program JavaScript at high school, I was not interested in creating
pop-up ads, but there was a lot of fun and quirky things you could do with pop-up windows.
Many of those were documented or used on various GeoCities sites and elsewhere. A unique aspect
of the simple web scripting in the late 1990s was that you could always learn how a particular
trick works by using the "View source" command in your web browser. This generally worked, because
scripts were small enough (so they did not require any sophisticated software engineering methods)
and there was no compilation or minification step involved (so you got readable source code).
That way, you could learn how a web page implements whatever effect it includes and reuse it in
your own web page. (To experience this first-hand, you are welcome to copy the mouse cursor
following stars from this page!)</p>
<p>If you were trying to outsmart your friends, the most obvious thing to try was to create a pop-up
window that cannot be closed, by opening exactly the same pop-up in the <code>onbeforeunload</code> event.
Or, even better, open two windows!</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Popup from Hell running in IE5 on Windows 98 virtual machine</p>
</div>
<p>The above is an actual implementation of the idea, running in Internet Explorer 5 in Windows 98
in Virtual Box (which you can get from <a href="https://archive.org/details/Windows98vdi/">Web Archive</a>).
The code fits in one page. All you need to do is to write a function that opens a pop-up using
<code>window.open</code>, adds some <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> to the newly opened window and then registers an event
handler for the <code>body.onbeforeunload</code> event to open two new such windows. As a bonus, I also
created a fancy background using the all time favourite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EemkRXpoeEg">spray tool in Microsoft Paint</a>!</p>

<h2>Growing opacity of web programs</h2>
<p>My reason for talking about pop-ups is not merely nostalgic. I think there is something very
interesting going on if we look at how programs for the web evolved between 1990s and 2020s.
A major development is certainly a growth of complexity. In some cases,
this is essential complexity. An application like Google Sheets is clearly doing more than
what people envisioned in the 1990s. In other cases, the growing complexity is accidental.
Web pages that simply display content nowadays load a lot of JavaScript for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>However, the way scripts and applications that run on the web are written has also changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transpilation and bundling.</strong>
The first notable change is that nowadays, most JavaScript is not written by humans, but
generated by some kind of pre-processor. This may be a compiler that turns code in other
languages, <a href="https://fable.io/">like F#</a>, into JavaScript, a module bundler that inlines
dependencies or a minifier that makes the resulting file smaller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>From windows to in-page elements.</strong>
As I wrote above, web pages nowadays rarely use system windows and instead re-create similar
experience inside the web page. Pop-up ads are one obvious example, but the same thing
happens with standard dialog windows; <code>window.prompt</code>, <code>window.confirm</code> and <code>window.alert</code>
have all been replaced by <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/">Bootstrap's modal</a>
and similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Canvas and WebAssembly.</strong>
Two recent technologies take both of the above trends even further. WebAssembly makes it
possible to run binary code in the browser and so compilers for the web can increasingly avoid
targeting JavaScript. Similarly, the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element makes it possible to increasingly avoid
using not just system windows, but also browser DOM elements. One example of this is
Google Docs, which <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html">are switching to canvas-based rendering</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do we gain?</h3>
<p>Many of the above developments are motivated by <em>performance</em>. Bundlers and minifiers make
resulting files smaller to download; WebAssembly makes it possible to produce efficient
compiled code for high-performance calculations; even the Google Docs move to canvas-based
rendering is motivated by performance.</p>
<p>A less frequently cited motivation for some of the above is that they hide more about a program
from the system or the user. This is clearly the case for in-browser pop-ups, where the browser
no longer sees what is going on in the page and cannot block it. It may also sometimes be the case
for minification that makes the resulting JavaScript harder to copy. You can no longer just view
the source and copy your favourite cursor follow effect! Although you can still view and re-format
the source code, extracting any meaningful logic from it becomes hard.</p>
<p>Finally, compiling code in other languages to JavaScript is clearly motivated by programmers
wanting to use their preferred (presumably better) programming languages. This is why <a href="http://tomasp.net/commodore64/">most</a>
<a href="http://tomasp.net/histogram/">of my</a> <a href="http://tomasp.net/coeffects/">interactive</a>
<a href="https://compostjs.github.io/compost/">web</a> <a href="https://thegamma.net/">projects</a> use F# under the
cover! Interestingly, many of those compilers initially try to generate relatively clean JavaScript.
The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121024063747/https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript web in 2012</a>
said <em>"TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript,"</em>
but in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20211005223345/https://www.typescriptlang.org/">2021</a>, the page
only says that <em>"TypeScript code converts to JavaScript which runs anywhere JavaScript runs."</em>
The F# to JavaScript compiler <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a> still claims to produce <em>"readable JavaScript,"</em>
although actually reading the JavaScript output requires a fair bit of knowledge about internal
representation of various constructs in F# and Fable.</p>
<h3>What do we lose?</h3>
<p>A more interesting question is what do we lose by the growing opacity of programs on the web.
One interesting issue is accessibility, because assistive technologies like screen readers
rely on being able to analyse the structure (DOM) of the web page. In the <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html">Google Docs
announcement</a>,
the authors later added an "update" explaining that they will ensure such tools will continue
to work, but this requires writing extra code that instructs the tools, rather than just
relying on the fact that they can see the structure of the page.</p>
<p>More generally, the more the structure of the web page is hidden from the system, the more we
lose the ability to build tools that somehow leverage the structure. If you view the source of
a web page in modern developer tools (Figure 4), you can see the structure and manually modify
it (a useful trick to read some paywalled content!) You can also write a quick script to extract
some data from the page (I did this when dealing with some of our student records!)
Browser extensions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey">Greasemonkey</a> rely on
this and there is also active research on how the openness of the web could enable new
user experience. For an impressive example, see <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/">Geoffrey Litt's Wildcard project</a>.
None of this will be possible when all web rendering moves to <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2>Editor war for the 21st century</h2>
<p>Before I share more general observations about software evolution, I want to briefly mention
another interesting bit of recent software history, which is the competition between two
text editors. I'm not talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">Emacs vs Vim</a>,
but about the competition between the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom editor</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio
Code</a>. The two editors are based on a very similar technology.
They are both based on the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> framework, which makes it
possible to write desktop applications in JavaScript, using web browser technologies for rendering.</p>
<p>Yet, there is one interesting difference, often attributed to (maybe not surprisingly if you
read the above section) performance and extensibility. When you create an extension for the Atom
editor, it gets a full access to the structure of the document. You can manually modify this
(Figure 5) and you can create extensions that modify the structure in whatever way you want.
This may go wrong (of course) but it also means that you can create quite powerful Atom-based
tools. (I used this several years ago to create an <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fslab-ionide/">interactive F# environment for data
science</a>.)</p>
<p>The side-effect of this design is that Atom extensions need to run in the same process as the
main editor user interface, in order to be able to access the DOM. This is one of the reasons
that make the Atom editor slower. (Reminding me of the "Eight megabytes and constantly swapping"
joke about Emacs.)  In Visual Studio Code, you can also manually look at the structure (as in
Figure 5), but this cannot be done programmatically from an extension. Extensions are loaded as
separate processes and they do not have full access to the document structure. This improves
the performance, but it limits what extensions can do. They can only access the editor through
the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api">extension API</a>. This includes all the expected extensibility
points, such as adding support for new programming languages or creating new views, but it
does not let you extend the editor in ways that the designers did not already think of.
(At least, not without forking the editor itself.)</p>

<h2>What is good for the User?</h2>
<p>Many of the developments that make programs more opaque are presented as being good for the user.
After all, who would not want a more efficient developer tooling or document processor? Yet,
many of the developments that make programs opaque also take something from the users. In many
of the discussions in the <a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/">PROGRAMme project</a> that I'm happy to
be a part of, <a href="https://pro.univ-lille.fr/liesbeth-de-mol/">Liesbeth De Mol</a> started using a
distinction between a "user" and a "User" that I will follow here.</p>
<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center;"><img src="prefs.png" style="max-width:450px;border:solid 3px black" />
<p><strong>Figure 6.</strong> Disadvantages of disabling ad personalization</p></div>
<p>The User with upper-case U is an abstract persona constructed by corporations like Apple or Facebook that
only needs what the companies provide. In contrast a lower-case user is a real human with interests
not determined by the software they use. The transition from user to User follows a transition from
hackers, who had not only their own interests, but were also often changing the software they used
to suit their needs.</p>
<p>The growth of opacity is only a good thing for the User. It offers a more polished and efficient
programs that perfectly address the needs of the User. In doing so, it leaves aside the needs of
the lower-case u user and even more the needs of hackers who may actually want to modify the
software they use to suit their needs. (In the case of pop-up blocking, the User defined by the
software producers presumably wants to "engage with relevant advertisement opportunities"
and see "more useful ads", Figure 6.)</p>
<h2>Embedding of programs in a system</h2>
<p>To make the idea of <em>program opacity</em> more precise, we can talk about the way in which a program
is embedded in a system that hosts it. In case of the web, this is the relationship between the
web application and a browser; in the editor war, it is the relationship between an extension
and the editor. In some cases, the distinction is less exact. A Smalltalk program lives in the
same image as the rest of the system, but we can still draw a line between the two.</p>
<p>The way a program utilizes the system in which it runs is a scale with two extreme ends
that I'm going to call <em>shallow</em> and <em>deep</em> embedding (borrowing terms used in the functional
programming language community for talking about <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~josefs/publications/TFP12.pdf">domain-specific
languages</a>):</p>
<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center;"><img src="smalltalk.png" style="max-width:450px;" />
<p><strong>Figure 7.</strong> Smalltalk user interface</p></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Shallow embedding.</strong> In this case, the program reuses as many features of the system as
possible. Many aspects of the program are delegated to the system, meaning that the program
may not have a full control over them (for example, the look of a user interface). Because of
this, the system can see (to an extent) what a program works with and what is it trying to do.
It can use this to implement assistive technologies or block undesirable program behaviour.
(<a href="https://www.humprog.org/~stephen/#reflective-unix">Stephen Kell's reflective Unix project</a>
can be seen as making Unix programs more shallowly embedded in the operating system.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deep embedding.</strong> Here, the program leverages only the minimum provided by the system and
uses this to re-implement features (such as user interface elements) that are already provided
by the system. One example is custom text rendering using <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> when the browser already
supports text rendering through HTML. Another example is on the boundary between Smalltalk
runtime and the host operating system (rather than Smalltalk program running inside Smalltalk
runtime), where the Smalltalk runtime does not leverage many of the operating system features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Laws of program opacity evolution</h2>
<p>In the case of the web, we can see an evolution from <em>shallow embedding</em> in the early days of the
web to a <em>deep embedding</em> in the contemporary web technologies. In the case of the Atom vs. Visual
Studio Code war, the latter forces extensions to use <em>shallow embedding</em> by restricting what the
extensions can do (by offering only limited API) so that they have to rely on system features for
most of what they do.</p>
<p>We can use this perspective to look at a number of other programs and systems. For example,
the Apple AppStore attempts to prevent one particular kind of deep embedding through its terms
and conditions when it forbids applications from using and downloading interpreted code
(Apple does not go as far as it possibly could. In particular, it does let applications to control
the look of their user interface, but you can easily imagine how that could become a requirement
for "consistency reasons").</p>
<h3>Is growth of opacity a law?</h3>
<p>There are two questions with which I want to conclude the blog post. The first question is
whether growth of opacity of programs is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman%27s_laws_of_software_evolution">law of software evolution</a>
in the sense captured by Lehman. I only looked at a small number of cases to answer this,
but some of the motivations for growing opacity seem very common. For example, compiling another
language to JavaScript and attempts to improve performance are generally an attempt to do
something <em>better</em> (bordering with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">Not Invented Here</a> syndrome).
Yet, there are many ways in which the growth of opacity can be prevented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of resources.</strong> Simply not having resources to re-invent the wheel means that
programmers will likely reuse more of the features offered by the system, rather than
trying to recreate functionality on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community cohesion.</strong> Opacity of programs may not grow in small enough developer communities
where everybody agrees that the system is well-designed. This is likely why there are so
many compilers to JavaScript, but no compilers compiling other languages to Smalltalk (that
I know of!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulation.</strong> As already mentioned, Apple AppStore prevents certain forms of opacity
through regulation in terms and conditions. This is another way of restricting program
opacity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>When is opacity bad?</h3>
<p>My second closing question is whether (the possibility of) the growth of opacity is a good or
bad thing. It is certainly a characteristic of software that has a significant impact on the
user (or the User). A more opaque system may be more efficient or may be able to achieve
functionality that is otherwise impossible, but it is less open to modification and extensibility.
I guess the question may be whether you as a user are more on the "side of system" or on the
"side of the program".</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>On the side of the system.</strong> If I use a web browser to view a page that has some annoying
pop-ups or a poorly sorted data table, I'm on the side of the system - I want to be able to
use the system to control the web page, block pop-ups and extract data. In this case,
shallow embedding allows me to do more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On the side of the program.</strong> If I'm writing an application for iOS, I do not want to be
told by Apple how to do things. If I want to download and interpret code (or create quirky
user interface), I should be allowed to do that! In this case, deep embedding is the more
desirable end of the spectrum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with my previous work looking at <a href="http://tomasp.net/commodore64">Commodore 64 BASIC</a>, I think
there are interesting things to be learned from the history of the web. The growth of opacity
on the modern web has definitely allowed us to build more complex web applications, but it also
has its costs. Learnability and extensibility (if we all move to <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and WASM) are
two such things. Now, you could argue that this is not really true, because many components that
are involved in modern web page construction are open-source (or even hosted on NPM) and are
in fact <em>easier</em> to reuse. I do not think this is the case, because it widens the gap between
the programmer and the (upper-case) User.</p>
