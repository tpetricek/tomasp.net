        <h1>Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</h1>
<p>Some time ago, I started writing a series about the differences between the asynchronous model in F# 
  (in Visual Studio 2010) and the asynchronous language extensions for C# proposed at PDC 2010.
  In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">first article</a>, I showed
  how both of the language features look and I highlighted a couple of differences. In the
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">second article</a>, I discussed
  the support for cancellation (available only in F#) and how the two models differ 
  <em>semantically</em> (i.e. what are differences in the behaviour). However, I didn't talk about more
  techincal differences and, in particular, how is the asynchronous code compiled. We'll look 
  at this topic today...</p>

<p>Although the C# asynchronous programming model is very similar to F# asynchronous workflows,
  the compilation looks quite different. The C# compiler uses a similar technique as when compiling
  iterators and creates a state machine, while the F# compiler uses an approach based on higher order
  functions (combinators) that's shared with (most) other computation expressions.</p>

<p>I won't discuss the syntax of F# asynchronous workflows or the C# asynchronous extensions in 
  this article, so if you're new to one of these, here are links to other articles in this 
  series: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (I.): Simultaneous introduction</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (II.): How do they differ?</a></li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</strong></li>
  <li>Asynchronous C# and F# (IV.): Calling F# libraries from C# <em>(not yet available)</em></li>
</ul>  

<p>Let's start by looking at the mechanism used in the C# compiler. If you already know how
  iterators work in C# 2.0, then you'll find it quite easy to understand. If you're not familiar
  with iterators, then don't worry - I'll make the explanation self-contained.</p>

<h2>State-machine async compilation in C#</h2>
<p>To explain the compilation, I'll use slightly simplified version of code that downloads
  the contents of a web page from <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">the first article</a>.
  I'll omit disposal using the <code>using</code> construct and also exception handling, so that
  I can show you (roughly) what the C# compiler generates in a few lines of code that can be 
  explained. If you want to see the translation in its full beauty, then you can use
  <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/">Reflector</a>. We'll look at the 
  compilation of the following snippet:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var request = HttpWebRequest.Create(url);
var response = await request.GetResponseAsync();
var stream = response.GetResponseStream();

do {
  count = await stream.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
  temp.Write(buffer, 0, count);
} while (count &gt; 0);

temp.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
// (Some code at the end of the method omitted)
return Tuple.Create(title, html.Length);
</pre>

<p>Leaving synchronous code aside, the snippet starts by asynchronously getting HTTP response
  (see the first <code>await</code> keyword). Then it enters a loop in which it asynchronously
  reads data from a stream (second <code>await</code> point) and then synchronously writes the
  data to a memory stream. At the end of the loop, it does some (synchronous) processing of the
  downloaded data.</p>

<p>The C# compiler turns the above method into a class. All local variables of the method
  are turned into fileds of the class (I also added underscore to the name). This is needed, because
  when an asynchronous operation is started, the method that starts it returns, so all state needs
  to be stored on heap (in private fields).</p>

<p>The body of the method is divided into blocks where each block runs some synchronous 
  code and then starts asynchronous operation. The operation is started in the background and
  the method that starts it returns immediately after starting it. (After returning, the current
  thread can do some other work, such as run another asynchronous computation, perform some GUI 
  update etc.) The individual blocks are all compiled into a single method named <code>MoveNext</code>
  that contains a big <code>switch</code> that runs the next block (which is stored in a
  private field <code>_state</code>):</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
public void MoveNext() {  
  switch (this._state) {
  case Initial:
    // State when the method is called - start getting response
    this._request = HttpWebRequest.Create(this._url);
    this._awaitResponse = request.GetResponseAsync();
    this._awaitResponse.TrySetContinuation(this.MoveNextDelegate);
    this._state = GotResponse;
    break;

  case GotResponse:
    // Got response - obtain the stream and start the loop
    this._response = this._awaitResponse.GetResult&lt;WebResponse&gt;();
    this._stream = this._response.GetResponseStream();
    goto case LoopBodyStart:

  case LoopBodyStart: 
    // Loop body - start reading next chunk of data to a buffer 
    this._awaitRead = this._stream.ReadAsync(this._buffer, 0, this._buffer.Length);
    this._awaitRead.TrySetContinuation(this.MoveNextDelegate);
    this._state = LoopAfterRead;
    break;

  case LoopAfterRead: 
    // Downloading completed - read the result and start writing
    this._count = this._awaitRead.GetResult&lt;int&gt;();
    this._temp.Write(this._buffer, 0, this._count);
    // If the loop has not completed, go to the beginning
    if (this._count &lt; 0) goto case LoopBodyStart;

    this._temp.Seek(0L, SeekOrigin.Begin);
    // (Some code at the end of the method omitted)
    this._state = Returned;
    this._result = Tuple.Create(this._title, this._html.Length);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The code is a beautified version of what the C# compiler generates, but the structure
  of the method is the same. This method is used to generate task that's returned as the result
  of the <code>async</code> method, but that's not as interesting (you can discover that yourself
  using Reflector). The interesting aspect is how the code executes:</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li>
    <p>At the beginning the state of the object (state machine) is <code>Initial</code>. When 
    an asynchronous method is called, the program actually calls our <code>MoveNext</code> method, which
    executes the first <code>case</code> of the <code>switch</code>. It (synchronously) creates HTTP
    web request and then calls the <code>GetResponseAsync</code> method. The result of the call
    is a <code>Task</code> that starts running in the background.</p>
    <p>Immediately after the asynchronous operation is started, the method continues executing. It
    uses <code>TrySetContinuation</code> to register a handler that will be executed after the 
    background operation completes and it configures the current state to run the next block 
    (<code>GotResponse</code>) when the <code>MoveNext</code> method is called the next time.</p></li>

  <li>
    <p>The <code>MoveNextDelegate</code> (set as a continuation in the previous step) refers to the 
      <code>MoveNext</code> method, so when the first asynchronous operation completes, the shown
      method will be called again. The current state is <code>GotResponse</code>, so it will execute
      the second block. In the block, it gets the <code>WebResponse</code> value using 
      <code>GetResult</code> and synchronously creates stream. Then it jumps to the start of the
      loop.</p></li>

  <li>
    <p>The body of the loop is first executed from the <code>GotResponse</code> state. Later, 
      it may be executed after the asynchronous operation inside the loop body completes in case
      when there are still some remaining data.</p>
    <p>Inside the body, we start the asynchronous operation <code>ReadAsync</code>, store
      the returned task in a local field and register a continuation to be called when the 
      operation completes. Then we set the state to <code>LoopAfterEnd</code>, so that the next
      block is executed after the reading completes.</p></li>

  <li>
    <p>In the <code>LoopAfterRead</code> state, we first get the result of the asynchronous
      operation and then write the data to a local stream. If there are some remaining data
      then the execution jumps back to the <code>LoopBodyStart</code> case and starts the next
      asynchronous operation. Otherwise, it processes the data and returns a result (by 
      setting the <code>_result</code> field).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Probably the most important fact about the asynchronous execution described above is that
  the <code>MoveNext</code> method (which contains all code from our original method translated
  into a state machine) is executed repeatedly and it never blocks the calling thread. When running
  asynchronous operation, it schedules the operation and then returns. When the operation completes,
  it will use the provided continuation to run <code>MoveNext</code> again to perform the next 
  step of the asynchronous computation.</p>

<h2>Combinator based compilation in F#</h2> 

<p>The way F# asynchronous workflows are compiled is quite different, but one key aspect is the same.
  The compiler needs to split the whole expression (or method body) into parts between asynchronous
  calls. This makes it possible to start an asynchronous operation and then release the current
  thread.</p>

<p>Let's now look at the same example implemented in F#. In the earlier versions of this code snippet,
  I used a recursive function to implement the looping. This would be translated to a recursive asynchronous
  workflow. However I thought it would be more interesting to show exactly the
  same code snippet that uses <code>while</code> loop in F# too. Here is the implementation of
  the download:</p>

<p>The snippet uses a mutable reference cell <code>count</code> to keep the number of bytes returned
  by the last <code>AsyncRead</code> call. We need to use a mutable value to be able to check it
  in the termination condition of the <code>while</code> loop. Otherwise, the code is essentially
  the same as the C# version. It contains two asynchronous operations written using <code>let!</code>
  and a single <code>while</code> loop. Let's look at the compiled form...</p>

<p>The essential principle of the compilation of asynchronous operations is that the compiler
  needs to (somehow) make it possible to start the operation in the background and specify the 
  rest of the method as a <em>continuation</em> that can be called when the operation completes.
  In C#, the <em>continuation</em> is the <code>MoveNext</code> method of some object (where the
  <code>_state</code> field of the object remembers the current location in the method body).
  In F#, the <em>continuation</em> is a (lambda) function that directly contains the rest of the
  body to be executed.</p>

<p>When compiling F# asynchronous workflows, the compiler turns each non-standard operation into
  a call to some primitive of the computation builder (e.g. <code>async</code>) and transforms the
  rest of the code into a continuation:</p>

<p>Compared to the state machine compilation done by the C# compiler, the transformation 
  performed by the F# compiler is quite simple. It follows these rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>let!</code> bindings are translated to calls to the <code>Bind</code> member. The
    asynchronous operation is passed as the first argument and a continuation is passed as the 
    second argument.</li>
  <li><code>while</code> loop containing asynchronous operation is translated to a call to the 
    <code>While</code> member. The first argument is a function that evaluates the termination
    condition and the second parameter is the body (which can be executed repeatedly).</li>
  <li>Sequence of expressions (e.g. <code>while</code> loop and the expression that follows it)
    is combined using the <code>Combine</code> member that takes two workflows and returns a 
    single one that runs both of them in a sequence.</li>
  <li>The whole computation is wrapped inside <code>Delay</code> (so that it doesn't start
    running the first few (synchronous) lines when creating an asynchronous workflow)</li>
</ul>

<p>The translated version of the code doesn't reveal anything about how F# asynchronous workflows
  run (when started using <code>Async.Start</code> or other method). The behavior is all encapsulated
  in the primitive members that are used to build the workflow (such as <code>Bind</code> and
  <code>While</code>). However, the execution proceeds similarly to the corresponding C# example.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the workflow is started, it runs the function passed as an argument to <code>Delay</code>.
    The function calls <code>AsyncGetResponse</code> to create a workflow representing the operation and
    passes it to <code>Bind</code>.</li>
  <li><code>Bind</code> starts the operation and provides it a continuation (our lambda function)
    that will be called after the operation completes. Then the <code>Bind</code> member returns
    and so the calling thread can do some other work.</li>
  <li>When the lambda function is called (with <code>response</code> as an argument), it synchronously
    gets the response stream. Then it constructs a workflow that will be executed next by 
    combining a <code>while</code> loop with consecutive code.</li>
  <li>The workflow returned by the <code>Combine</code> combinators starts the first workflow
    (constructed by <code>While</code>). It repeatedly runs the body of the loop (which is itself
    an asynchronous workflow) until the termination condition returns <code>false</code>.</li>
  <li>When the workflow constructed by <code>While</code> completes, the code generated by
    <code>Combine</code> calls the second workflow, which performs some (synchronous) processing
    and then constructs &amp; returns a workflow that reports the result (using <code>Return</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Comparison</h2>
<p>The approaches used by C# and F# are quite different and both have pros and cons. The key advantage
  of the state machine compilation is that it generates more efficient code. However, this is probably
  not a big concern for asynchronous code, which spends most of the time waiting for some 
  I/O operation or an external event. However, if you used <code>async</code> to write CPU bound code, 
  then there will probably be some difference in the performance. Currently, the F# compiler
  performs similar translation when compiling <em>sequence expressions</em> (where efficiency depends
  more on the compilation). I remember talking about the compilation of asynchronous workflows with 
  Don Syme during my second internship (two years ago :-)), so this may eventually be added to F# too.</p>

<p>The key advantage of the compilation based on combinators is that it is very flexible. The 
  implementation is hidden in a library that can be easily changed. This also makes it possible
  to implement more complicated behavior - for example, the support for cancellation. Moreover, 
  F# asynchronous workflows are just an example of <em>computation expressions</em>, which means that
  the compiler doesn't know anything about them. The same mechanism can be used to implement
  a wide range of other interesting computations (e.g. my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-ii-break.aspx">
  article about implementing <code>break</code> in F#</a>).</p>
