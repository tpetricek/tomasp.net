# tomasp.net (Move Cheese Fractal to .net core)
It's moved to .net core and slightly refactored version of Tomas Petricek's Cheese Fractal. To run it in F# Interactive (FSI), you'll have to use .net FRAMEWORK based FSI. Check this discussion for more details. Briefly that's because .net core FSI isn't able to resolve WPF DLLs.
