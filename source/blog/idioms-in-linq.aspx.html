<h1>Beyond the Monad fashion (I.): Writing idioms in LINQ</h1>

<p>The truth is
that LINQ syntax can be used for encoding <em>queries</em> (obviously), <em>monads</em> (as you were told), but also for <em>idioms</em> as you'll learn today (and quite possibly for other types of computations). In this article, we look at a basic example, but I'll describe a more complex real-world scenario in the next blog post.</p>

<h2>Monads and LINQ</h2>
<p>To set the scene, we I briefly demonstrate the encoding of monads using LINQ. You can find similar examples in quite
  a few blog posts on the internet (and at any serious .NET conference these days). 
  I covered the topic in detail in my <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a> book. The Chapter 12 which 
  explains monads and LINQ is <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/SampleChapter12.pdf">available for free as a sample chapter</a>
  [<a href="#csidiomsl">5</a>]. </p>
<p>The example I used in the book uses values of type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. The value can either contain a value of type <code>T</code>
  (<code>Option.Some</code>) or it can be empty (<code>Option.None</code>). It is similar to <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> with 
  the only difference that the contained value can also be a reference type). When working with options, you can use LINQ syntax to 
  write computations that can fail and return <code>Option.None</code> at any time without explicitly checking for it:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var res = from n in TryReadInt()
          from m in TryReadInt()
          select n + m;
</pre>
<p>The sample tries to read number from the console (<code>TryReadInt</code>). If the user enters two valid numbers, the result 
  will be <code>Option.Some</code> containing the sum. However, if the user enters wrong input, the rest of the computation
  will not run and the result will be immediately <code>Option.None</code>.</p>

<h2>Introducing idioms</h2>

<p>Monads are certainly very nice, but as I wrote, they are not the only notion of computation that we can use. 
  In this article, we'll look at <em>idioms</em>, but there is quite a few of them (another interesting example
  is <em>comonads</em>; you can find a short Haskell introduction here [<a href="#csidiomsl">1</a>]).
  Idioms are particularly interesting because they are closely related to monads.
  They are weaker than monads, which means that all monads are idioms, but not all idioms are automatically monads. 
  Let me first quote Conor McBride and Ross Paterson who described idioms and I'll clarify everything shortly:</p>
  
<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; font-style:italic;">
  The moral is this: if you’ve got an <code>Applicative</code> functor, that’s good; if you’ve also
  got a <code>Monad</code>, that’s even better! And the dual of the moral is this: if you want a
  <code>Monad</code>, that’s good; if you only want an <code>Applicative</code> functor, that’s even better!
</p>

<p>In the object oriented terms, you can think of <em>idiom</em> and <em>monad</em> as two interfaces. The <em>monad</em> interface inherits from the 
  <em>idiom</em> interface. When you write some method, you'll prefer to take <em>idiom</em> as an argument (because this means that 
  your method can work with more objects). If you're defining a class, you'll prefer to implement <em>monad</em>, because it means that
  your object can be passed even to methods that have stronger requirements (that require <em>monad</em> and not just <em>idiom</em>).</p>

<h3>Defining an idiom</h3>
<p>Both monads and idioms are defined in terms of a few simple operations that they need to provide. For monads, one of the operations
  is <code>Bind</code> (which is similar to <code>SelectMany</code> in LINQ) and the other operation is <code>Return</code> (it doesn't
  have a direct correspondence in LINQ, but imagine you could write <code>var q = select 10</code> to create a list containing 
  a single value 10).</p>

<p>The operations that are required by idiom are <code>Return</code> (just like for monads), <code>Select</code> (which happens
  to be the same thing as <code>Select</code> in LINQ) and <code>Merge</code> (in the academic terminology, they are usually called
  <em>unit</em>, <em>map</em> and <small style="font-size:70%;">&#9733;</small>). The operations should have the following types
  (I'm using the F# syntax, so <code>-&gt;</code> stands for the <code>Func</code> delegate or a method):</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Operations required by a Monad
Return : R -&gt; Monad&lt;R&gt;
Bind   : Monad&lt;T&gt; -&gt; Func&lt;T, Monad&lt;R&gt;&gt; -&gt; Monad&lt;R&gt;

// Operations required by an Idiom
Return : R -&gt; Idiom&lt;R&gt;
Select : Idiom&lt;T&gt; -&gt; Func&lt;T, R&gt;) -&gt; Idiom&lt;R&gt;
Merge  : Idiom&lt;T1&gt; -&gt; Idiom&lt;T2&gt; -&gt; Idiom&lt;Tuple&lt;T1, T2&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>The <code>Return</code> operation does the same thing as <code>Return</code> for monads. It turns an ordinary value
  into a value wrapped inside idiom. This could mean a different thing for a different type of computations. For option values
  from the introduction, we could wrap the value using <code>Option.Some</code>.</p>
<p>You may already have some intuition about <code>Select</code> from LINQ. It should turn all values inside one idiom
  into different values (using the provided function) and wrap them inside an idiom with the same structure. For options, we
  would turn <code>Option.Some</code> into <code>Option.Some</code> containing the calculated value; for lists, we would
  apply the function to all elements of a list.
</p>
<p>The <code>Merge</code> operation is the key thing. It takes two idioms and combines them into a new idiom that contains
  two-element tuples. The first element is some value from the first idiom and the second value comes from the second idiom.
  If you carefully look at all the <code>Enumerable</code> members in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.enumerable.aspx" type="external">MSDN documentation</a>, 
  you'll find a method that has a very similar signature. You'll find out which method I'm talking about in the next
  section when we define our first idiom...
</p>

<h2>Writing our first idiom</h2>
<p>There are two ways to define an idiom for <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>. As already mentioned, when you have a monad, you also
  automatically get an idiom. I'll show you how to do that later, but it is possible to implement <code>Merge</code> in terms of <code>Bind</code>.
  In that case, the <code>Merge</code> operation will behave essentially as <em>cross-join</em>, which means that it generates
  all combinations of the elements from the two sequences. For example, if you have <code>[1; 2]</code> and <code>[a; b; c]</code> you'll get
  <code>[1,a; 1,b; 1,c; 2,a; 2,b; 2,c]</code>. This isn't a very interesting example, because we can do that with monads. However,
  there is another option...</p>

<h3>Implementing ZipList idiom</h3>
<p>The alternative implementation is to use the <code>Zip</code> operation as <code>Merge</code>. The <code>Zip</code> operation [<a href="#csidiomsl">3</a>] takes two 
  collections and generates a new one by taking elements at the corresponding indices. If you have <code>[1; 2; 3]</code> and 
  <code>[a; b; c]</code> you'll get <code>[1,a; 2,b; 3,c]</code>. There is only a single sensible way to implement the <code>Select</code>
  and that's to use the same behavior as LINQ. However, the <code>Return</code> operation may be surprising. Let's look at the three methods:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Returns an infinite sequence containing the specified value
public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Return&lt;T&gt;(T value) {
  while (true) yield return value;
}

// Merges corresponding elements from two sequences into tuples
public static IEnumerable&lt;Tuple&lt;T1, T2&gt;&gt; Merge&lt;T1, T2&gt;
    (this IEnumerable&lt;T1&gt; first, IEnumerable&lt;T2&gt; second) {
  return Enumerable.Zip(first, second, Tuple.Create);
}

// Applies the specified function to all elements of source 
public static IEnumerable&lt;R&gt; Select&lt;T, R&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; source, Func&lt;T, R&gt; func) {
  foreach(var el in source) yield return func(el);
}
</pre>

<p>In the usual List monad (that roughly corresponds to LINQ), the <code>Return</code> operation returns a single-element
  sequence that contains the specified value. However, for the ZipList idiom, we need a different behavior. When we look at some
  examples, you'll see that this implementation allows us to write useful things just using the idiom operations. Another 
  reason is that idioms should obey some laws to give a reasonable definition. You can think of laws as unit tests that should
  hold for any random input. One of the laws about <code>Return</code> is:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
[Test]
public void LeftIdentity&lt;T&gt;(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; source) {
  Assert.AreEqual( source, source.Merge(ZipList.Return(0)).Select(tup => tup.Item1) );
}
</pre>

<p>Common unit testing frameworks wouldn't be able to randomly generate values for the argument, but you get the idea. The 
  law says that if you <code>Merge</code> any sequence with a sequence generated using <code>Return</code> and then take
  only the first element of the tuple, you should get the same thing as the original sequence. This is something that
  sounds obvious, but it wouldn't work if we used <code>Return</code> that generates only a single element.</p>

<h3>Programming with ZipList</h3>
<p>Now that we have idiom for ZipList, let's see how we can use the provided operations to solve some problems.
  We'll start with a basic example that calculates average price of stock prices over several days that are stored
  in sequence of sequences:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Changing prices of 4 different stocks over 3 days
var prices = new[] { 
  new[] { 10.0, 4.0, 13.0, 20.0 },
  new[] { 12.0, 3.0, 11.0, 25.0 },
  new[] {  9.0, 1.0, 16.0, 24.0 },
};

// Calculate average price for each stock
var res = ZipList.Return(0.0);
foreach (var day in prices)
  res = res.Merge(day).Select(tup => tup.Item1 + tup.Item2);
var avg = res.Select(sum => sum / prices.Count());

// Print results: 10.3, 2.6, 13.3 and 23 
foreach (var price in avg)
  Console.Write("{0}, ", price);
</pre>

<p>How does the calculation of the average work? We first need to sum all prices over the three days. To do that, we 
  add prices for all days to the current sum in a <code>foreach</code> loop. To add values, we <code>Merge</code> the
  results so far with the prices for the current day and then use <code>Select</code> to add them. As an initial value,
  we use a sequence containing zeros generated using <code>Return</code>. A nice thing is that we don't need to 
  explicitly specify the length of the sequence, because <code>Merge</code> can take as many zeros from it as needed.</p>

<p>This was a fairly simple example, but we'll look at a more complicated one later. First of all, let's look how
  LINQ fits into the picture.</p>

<h2>Writing idioms using LINQ</h2>
<p>The LINQ query syntax doesn't provide any direct way for encoding idioms. However, we can misuse one of the 
  standard query operators for this purpose. There aren't many benefits in a simple example like this one. In the
  next blog post, we'll look at a larger example and the syntax will be quite useful. The keyword that we can
  misuse is <code>join</code>:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
var res = ZipEnumerable.Return(0.0);
foreach (var day in prices)
  res = from sum in res
        join price in day on 1 equals 1
        select sum + price;
var avg = from sum in res select sum / prices.Count();
</pre>

<p>When using <code>join</code> for implementing actual database joins, we can specify keys that should be
  matched using the <code>equals</code> clause. When encoding idioms, we just ignore the clause, so I'll 
  always write just <code>on 1 equals 1</code>. The reason why we can use <code>join</code> for encoding idioms
  is because it is translated to <code>Join</code> calls in a way that's very similar to what we need to write
  when using <code>Merge</code> directly (You can find more details in the C# specification [<a href="#csidiomsl">4</a>]). 
  The key difference is that you cannot use variables declared earlier in the query (e.g. <code>sum</code>) in the
  expression that specifies data source for joining (e.g. <code>day</code>).</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>When working with idioms, we cannot select data source depending on a value from previous data source. This 
  essentially means that all the data sources used by one or more <code>join</code> clauses and the first <code>from</code>
  clause will be combined using <code>Merge</code>. Then the query will use <code>Select</code> to evaluate the expression
  specified in <code>select</code>. This is different than monads encoded using multiple <code>from</code> clauses 
  where the next <code>from</code> expression can depend on earlier variables. For example, when using monads, you can write:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var q = from cat in RandomCategories()
        from prod in ProductsInCategory(cat.ID)
        select prod.Name;
</pre>
<p>Note that we can use the <code>cat</code> value in the <code>in</code> part of the second <code>from</code> clause.
  This is because the translation that C# uses for multiple <code>from</code> clauses and the translation used
  for <code>join</code> is very different (and the variable simply isn't in scope when using <code>join</code>).
  Because of the translation, the <code>Join</code> method also has quite different type than the <code>SelectMany</code>
  method (used by monads). If you write the declaration of the <code>Join</code> method (and decide to ignore the
  two key selectors), you can easily find a way to implement it in terms of <code>Merge</code> and <code>Select</code>
  provided by any idiom:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
// Allows using of the join keyword for writing idiom computations
// (they two key selectors are ignored and users can just write 'on 1 equals 1')
public static IEnumerable&lt;TResult&gt; Join&lt;TOuter, TInner, TKey, TResult&gt;
  (this IEnumerable&lt;TOuter&gt; outer, IEnumerable&lt;TInner&gt; inner,
    Func&lt;TOuter, TKey&gt; outerKeySelector,
    Func&lt;TInner, TKey&gt; innerKeySelector,
    Func&lt;TOuter, TInner, TResult&gt; resultSelector) {

  // Implementation using just 'Merge' and 'Select'
  // that can be provided by any idiom
  return outer.Merge(inner).Select(tup =&gt; resultSelector(tup.Item1, tup.Item2));
}
</pre>
<p>In fact, the implementation could just directly use <code>Enumerable.Zip</code>. However, I wanted to write it
  explicitly using <code>Merge</code> and <code>Select</code>, because these two are the operations used to define
  idioms in the original paper about idioms [<a href="#csidiomsl">1</a>] (In fact, the paper gives two equivalent definitions and
  I'm using the second one, because it is easier to understand).</p>

<p>If you want, you can look at the query translation [<a href="#csidiomsl">4</a>] and try to rewrite the 
  LINQ query above (or use Reflector or similar tools) to see how the C# compiler desugars the query. However, the fact that
  we could directly implement <code>Join</code> (without key selectors) using operations from an idiom means
  that the computation is using just operations of the idiom (in some way) and that the code is equivalent to what 
  we wrote earlier explicitly.</p>

<h2>Transposing matrices with idioms</h2>
<p>One example of using idioms that you can find in the original paper [<a href="#csidiomsl">1</a>] is matrix transposition.
  We can implement that using our ZipList idiom and the encoding using LINQ as well. The implementation won't be 
  very efficient (it was designed to work with lazy functional lists), but it is an interesting demonstration.
  In the next blog post, I'll show you how to implement a more real-world idiom, so the purpose of the example
  isn't to convince you that writing idioms using LINQ is a good idea - instead, I just want to demonstrate that
  we can rewrite any example from the original article. The following method implements the transposition
  using the LINQ syntax for idioms:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
IEnumerable&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt; Transpose&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt; matrix) {
  return matrix.Count() == 0 ?

    // Processed all rows - return infinite sequence of empty lists
    ZipList.Return(Enumerable.Empty&lt;T&gt;()) :

    // Zip all elements from the first row 'matrix.First()' with rows of 
    // recursively transposed sub-matrix starting from the second row
    from xs in matrix.First()
    join xss in Transpose(matrix.Skip(1)) on 1 equals 1
    select Enumerable.Concat(new[] { xs }, xss);
}
</pre>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/idioms-in-linq/transpose.png" style="float:right; margin:5px 0px 5px 20px" />

<p>This function is a bit tricky, but you can understand it by looking at the diagram on the right.
  We start processing the matrix by taking the first row. Then we take a smaller sub-matrix that with
  the first row removed (<code>matrix.Skip(1)</code>) and transpose this sub-matrix. Once we have these
  two, we use ZipList idiom to merge individual columns of the first row and rows of the transposed
  matrix back together. 
</p>

<p>When we eventually reach the end, we need to generate a sequence that is at least as long as the
  height of the matrix. The sequence (representing rows) should contain empty sequences (representing
  columns) so that we can later append elements to the individual columns (using <code>Enumerable.Concat</code>).</p>

<p>If we wanted to write the same thing explicitly using the idiom operations, we'd just need to change the
  else clause of the conditional operator and use the following:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
ZipList.
  Merge(matrix.First(), Transpose(matrix.Skip(1))).
  Select(tuple => Enumerable.Concat(new[] { tuple.Item1 }, tuple.Item2));
</pre>
<p>As I already mentioned, the difference between the two syntactic options isn't as huge in this basic
  example. The main benefit of (mis-)using the query syntax is that we can avoid using tuples explicitly,
  which makes our life a bit easier. In this example, we're merging just two inputs, so the tuple is
  quite simple. In the next blog post, we'll need to merge a much larger number of idioms, so the
  code would look quite ugly and we'd have to work with tuples like <code>Tuple&lt;string, Tuple&lt;Unit, Tuple&lt;Unit, string&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The LINQ query syntax in C# is quite a powerful weapon. Obviously, it can be used for encoding queries,
  but you can use it to write other types of computations as well. There are quite a few blog posts and articles
  (including <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/SampleChapter12.pdf">freely available Chapter 12 of my book</a> [<a href="#csidiomsl">5</a>]
  that explain how to use LINQ syntax for working with monads.</p>

<p>However, saying that LINQ <em>is</em> a monad isn't quite right, because the LINQ syntax can be used for encoding
  other types of computations too. In this article, I demonstrated how to use it for writing code using
  <em>idioms</em>. Idioms are weaker than monads - in the object oriented terms, this means that the "monad interface"
  inherits from "idiom interface". As a result, some computation types can implement the "idiom interface", but cannot
  be written as monads. We looked at ZipList, which is one example of such computation type.</p>
<p>I demonstrated how you
  can use (somewhat surprisingly) the <code>join</code> clause to work with idioms and we also looked at 
  some examples. You've seen matrix transposition which is one of the examples used in the original paper that
  introduces idioms.</p>
<p>The ZipList example may look a little academic, but it was quite easy to explain. If you want to see a more
  practical example, stay tuned for the next blog post. I'll demonstrate using Formlets [<a href="#csidiomsl">6</a>],
  which is an idiom that can be used for constructing web forms.</p>
