<p>I started working on this project, because I attended C++ class at our university and I had to do some application in C++. Because I hate doing useless projects I wanted to work on something interesting and so I started thinking whether it would be possible to enable LINQ support in C++/CLI...</p>

<p>C++/CLI is a very flexible language and the following example proves that enabling LINQ support in C++/CLI isn't impossible. The following database query returns name of contact and company for all customers living in London:</p>

<pre lang="c++">
// create connection to database
NorthwindData db(".. connection string ..");

// declare database query
Expr&lt;Customers^&gt; cvar = Var&lt;Customers^&gt;("c");
CQuery&lt;String^&gt;^ q = db.QCustomers
  -&gt;Where(clq::fun(cvar, cvar.City == "London"))
  -&gt;Select(clq::fun(cvar, 
      cvar.ContactName + Expr&lt;String^&gt;(", ") + cvar.CompanyName));

// execute query and output results
for each(String^ s in q-&gt;Query)
  Console::WriteLine(s);

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The LINQ project which will be part of the next version of Visual Studio (codename "Orcas") is set of extensions that
    make it possible to query data sources directly from the C# or VB.NET languages. LINQ extends .NET Framework with classes
    to represent queries and both C# and VB.NET language with features that make it possible to write these queries easily.
    It also includes libraries for using queries with the most common types of data sources like SQL database, DataSets and
    XML files. This article requires some basic knowledge of LINQ and C# 3.0, so I recommend looking at the LINQ Overview available
    from the official project web site before reading the article.</p>
  <p>LINQ includes extensions for the C# and VB.NET, but there are no plans for supporting LINQ in C++/CLI. The goal of CLinq project
    is to allow using part of LINQ functionality from C++/CLI. Thanks to very powerful operator overloading mechanism in C++/CLI it is 
    possible to enable using LINQ to SQL for accessing SQL databases in C++/CLI as well as some other LINQ uses.</p>
  <p>I will first demonstrate how the same database query looks in C# 3.0 and C++/CLI and then we will look at CLinq in more detail. 
    The following query (written in C# 3.0) returns uses the Northwind database and returns name of contact and company for all 
    customers living in London:</p>    
<pre lang="csharp">
// create connection to database
NorthwindData db = new NorthwindData(".. connection string ..");

// declare database query
var q = 
  from cvar in db.Customers
  where cvar.City == "London"
  select cvar.ContactName + ", " + cvar.CompanyName;

// execute query and output results
foreach(string s in q)
  Console.WriteLine(s);
</pre>  
  <p>Now, let's look at the same query written in C++/CLI using CLinq. It is a bit more complex, but this is the price for 
    implementing it as a library instead of modifying the language:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// create connection to database
NorthwindData db(".. connection string ..");

// declare database query
Expr&lt;Customers^&gt; cvar = Var&lt;Customers^&gt;("c");
CQuery&lt;String^&gt;^ q = db.QCustomers
  -&gt;Where(clq::fun(cvar, cvar.City == "London"))
  -&gt;Select(clq::fun(cvar, 
      cvar.ContactName + Expr&lt;String^&gt;(", ") + cvar.CompanyName));

// execute query and output results
for each(String^ s in q-&gt;Query)
  Console::WriteLine(s);
</pre>  
  <h2>LINQ &amp; C++/CLI overview</h2>
  <p>In this section I'll very shortly recapitulate a few LINQ and C++/CLI features that are important for understanding how CLinq works.
    If you're familiar with LINQ and C++/CLI you can safely skip this section.</p>
  <h3>Important LINQ features</h3>
  <p>Probably the most important extension in C# that makes LINQ possible are lambda expressions. Lambda expressions
    are similar to anonymous delegates (but the syntax is even simpler). Lambda expressions can be used for declaring 
    functions inline and you can pass them as a parameter to methods. There is however one important difference to
    anonymous delegates - lambda expressions can be either compiled as executable code (like anonymous delegate) or 
    as a data structure that represents the lambda expression source code. The structure is called expression tree.
    Expression tree can be also compiled at runtime, so you can convert this representation to executable code.</p>
  <p>What LINQ to SQL does is that it takes the expression tree representing the query that contains lambda expressions 
    and converts it to the SQL query, which is sent to the SQL Server. LINQ to SQL also contain tool called <code>sqlmetal.exe</code>,
    which generates objects that represent the database structure, so when you're writing the queries you can 
    work with these type-safe objects instead of having to specify database tables or columns by name.</p>  
  
  <h3>Important C++/CLI features</h3>
  <p>Now I'd like to mention a few from the rich set of C++/CLI features. LINQ itself is available for .NET, so we'll
    use the ability to work with managed classes a lot in the whole project. We'll also use the ability to work with
    both C++ templates and .NET generics. CLinq benefits from the fact that .NET generics can be compiled and exported 
    from an assembly, while C++ templates are interesting thanks to their template specialization support, which means that
    if you have <code>SomeClass&lt;T&gt;</code> template, you can write special version for specified type parameter 
    (for example <code>SomeClass&lt;int&gt;</code>) and add modify behavior of this class, including the possibility
    to add methods, etc.</p>
  
  <h2>Basic CLinq features</h2>
  <p>In the previous example we used <code>Expr&lt;Customers^&gt;</code> and <code>Var&lt;Customers^&gt;</code> classes.
    This two classes are typed wrappers and are declared using C++/CLI templates. We use templates instead of generics,
    because templates allow us to use template specialization - this means that there are basic <code>Expr&lt;&gt;</code> and
    <code>Var&lt;&gt;</code> classes and these can be specialized, so for example <code>Expr&lt;Customers^&gt;</code> can contain
    some additional properties. Using these additional properties you can express operations with <code>Customers</code> class.
    These template specializations can be generated using the <code>clinqgen.exe</code> tool, which will be described later. CLinq
    also supports a bit more complex syntax that you can use for manipulating with classes that don't have template specializations. </p>
    
  <p>Before we start, I'll explain how the CLinq library organized is. It consists from two parts. First part is the <code>EeekSoft.CLinq.dll</code>
    assembly which contains core CLinq classes. You'll need to reference this assembly from your project either using project settings or 
    with the <code>#using</code> statement. Second part is the <code>clinq.h</code> header file (and 2 other headers) which contain
    C++/CLI templates and you'll need to include this header in every CLinq project. The header files are used because CLinq relies on C++/CLI 
    templates. The classes from the core library can be used if you want to share CLinq objects across more .NET projects.</p>  
  
  <p>I already mentioned the <code>Expr&lt;&gt;</code> class. This class is written using templates and it is included (together 
    with <code>Var&lt;&gt;</code>) from the <code>clinq.h</code> file. These two are inherited from classes in the CLinq assembly,
    namely <code>Expression&lt;&gt;</code> (there are some other classes in the assembly, but this one is the most important). This 
    class can be shared in multiple projects and it is written using .NET generics. It is recommended to use this class as a type for
    parameters of any public methods from your project that can be called from other .NET assembly.</p>
      
  <h3>Expr and Var classes</h3>
  <p>Let's look at some sample code. As you can see from the previous paragraph the <code>Expr&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>Var&lt;&gt;</code> 
    classes are key structures of the CLinq project, so we'll use them in the following example. The example works with two specialized
    versions of these classes - one for the <code>int</code> and second for the <code>String^</code> type:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// Declare variable of type int called 'x'
Expr&lt;int&gt; x = Var&lt;int&gt;("x");
// Declare expression of type String initialized with literal
Expr&lt;String^&gt; str("Hello world!");

// Expression representing addition of the x variable and 
// result of the method call to 'IndexOf' method.
Expr&lt;int&gt; expr = str.IndexOf("w") + x;
</pre>  
  <p>If you look at the code you could think that the <code>IndexOf</code> method and other operations are executed after the code is
    invoked, but this isn't true! This is important fact to note - the code only builds internal structures that represent the 
    expression, but <strong>the expression is not executed!</strong> This provides you with a similar behavior to the C# 3.0 lambda
    expressions which can be also used for building representation of the written expression instead of building executable code.
    You can also convert the expression represented by the <code>Expr&lt;&gt;</code> class to the structures used by LINQ as demonstrated
    in the following example:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// Convert to LINQ expression
System::Expressions::Expression^ linqExpr = expr.ToLinq();
// Print string representation of LINQ expression
Console::WriteLine(linqExpr);
</pre>
<p>The result printed to the console window will be:</p>
<pre lang="text">
Add("Hello world!".IndexOf("w"), x)
</pre>

  <h3>Lambda expressions</h3>  
  <p>Let's now look at the syntax for writing lambda expressions in CLinq. Lambda expressions are represented by generic 
    <code>Lambda&lt;&gt;</code> class. The type parameter of this class should be one of the <code>Func</code> delegates
    declared by LINQ in the <code>System::Query</code> namespace. For declaring lambda expressions you can use the <code>fun</code>
    function in the <code>EeekSoft::CLinq::clq</code> namespace. Assuming that you included <code>using namespace EeekSoft::CLinq;</code>
    directive (which is recommended), the source code will look like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// Declare parameter (variable) and method body (expression)
Expr&lt;int&gt; var = Var&lt;int&gt;("x");
Expr&lt;int&gt; expr = Expr&lt;String^&gt;("Hello world!").IndexOf("w") + var;

// First argument for the clq::fun function is lambda expression
// parameter, the last argument is the lambda expression body
Lambda&lt;Func&lt;int, int&gt;^&gt;^ lambda = clq::fun(var, expr);

// Print string representation of lambda..
Console::WriteLine(lambda-&gt;ToLinq());

// Compile &amp; execute lambda
Func&lt;int, int&gt;^ compiled = lambda-&gt;Compile();
Console::WriteLine(compiled(100));
</pre>  
  <p>After executing this example you should see the following output in console window (first line represents the lambda expression and
  the second line is the result of lambda expression invocation):</p>
<pre lang="text">
x => Add("Hello world!".IndexOf("w"), x)
106</pre>
  <p>Similarly to the LINQ you can compile the CLinq expression at runtime (actually CLinq internally uses LINQ). This was done in the 
    previous example using the <code>Compile</code> method. The returned type is one of the <code>Func&lt;&gt;</code> delegates 
    and this delegate can be directly invoked.</p>  
  <p>As in LINQ you can use only up to 4 parameters in lambda expressions (due to the limitations of <code>Func&lt;&gt;</code> delegates 
    declared in LINQ assemblies). Accordingly to this limitation, the <code>clq::fun</code> function has the same number of overloads.
    Also note that you don't have to specify type arguments to this function in most of the situations, because C++/CLI type inference
    algorithm can infer the types for you. Let's look at one more example that demonstrates declaring lambda expression with more than one parameter:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
Expr&lt;int&gt; x = Var&lt;int&gt;("x");
Expr&lt;int&gt; y = Var&lt;int&gt;("y");
Lambda&lt;Func&lt;int, int, int&gt;^&gt;^ lambda2 = 
  clq::fun(x, y, 2 * (x + y) );
Console::WriteLine(lambda2-&gt;Compile()(12, 9));
</pre>
  <p>In this example the body of the lambda expression isn't declared earlier as another variable, but composed directly
    in the <code>clq::fun</code> function. We also used overloaded operators (namely <code>*</code> and <code>+</code>) in the 
    body of lambda expression. If you run this code, the result will be <code>(12 + 9) * 2</code> which is <code>42</code>.</p>  
    
  <h3>Supported types and operators</h3>
  <p>In the previous example I used two overloaded operators. These operators are declared in the <code>Expr&lt;int&gt;</code>
    template specialization (so you can use them when working with an expression representing integer). CLinq includes template
    specializations with overloaded operators for the following standard types:</p>
  <table>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align:left; width:170px">Type</th>
    <th style="text-align:left;">Supported operators &amp; methods</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><code>bool</code></td>
    <td>Comparison: <code>!=</code>, <code>==</code>; Logical: <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>int</code></td>
    <td>Comparison: <code>!=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>; Math: <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>-</code>; Modulo: <code>%</code>; Shifts: <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>Other integral types</td>
    <td>Comparison: <code>!=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>; Math: <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>-</code>; Modulo: <code>%</code></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>Decimal</code></td>
    <td>Comparison: <code>!=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>; Math: <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>-</code></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>wchar_t</code></td>
    <td>Comparison: <code>!=</code>, <code>==</code></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>String^</code></td>
    <td>Comparison: <code>!=</code>, <code>==</code>; Concatenation: <code>+</code>; Standard string methods (<code>IndexOf</code>, <code>Substring</code>, etc..)</td>
  </tr></table>    
  <p>For complete list of supported types with list of methods and operators see <a href="/articles/clinq/documentation.html">generated documentation</a> 
  [<a href="/articles/clinq/documentation.html" target="_blank">^</a>].
    The following example demonstrates using overloaded operators with expressions representing <code>double</code> and <code>float</code>
    (mixing different type is another interesting problem, so that's why we use two different floating point types here):</p>  
<pre lang="c++">
// Declare 'float' variable and 'double' literal
Expr&lt;float&gt; fv = Var&lt;float&gt;("f");
Expr&lt;double&gt; fc(1.2345678);

// Function taking 'float' and returning 'float'
Lambda&lt;Func&lt;float, float&gt;^&gt;^ foo4 = clq::fun(fv, 
  clq::conv&lt;float&gt;(Expr&lt;Math^&gt;::Sin(fv * 3.14) + fc)  );
</pre>  
  <p>You can see that we're using another function from the <code>clq</code> namespace - the <code>clq::conv</code>. This function is used for converting
    types when implicit conversion is not available. In the sample we're using a <code>Sin</code> function which accepts <code>Expr&lt;double&gt;</code> 
    as a parameter. The variable of type <code>float</code> is converted to the expression of type <code>double</code> implicitly, but when conversion
    in the opposite direction is not possible, so we have to use <code>clq::conv</code> function. CLinq allows implicit conversion only from smaller floating
    point data type to larger (<code>float</code> to <code>double</code>) or from smaller integral type to larger (for example <code>short</code> 
    to <code>int</code>). This example also uses the <code>Expr&lt;Math^&gt;</code> class, which is another interesting template specialization. 
    This specialization represents the .NET <code>System::Math</code> class and contains most of the methods from this class.</p>
    
  <h2>Working with classes</h2>
  <p>I already demonstrated how you can work with basic data types, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, but I mentioned only a few 
    about working with another classes. There are two possible approaches - you can either use template specialization (if it exists) which 
    includes properties and methods that represent members of underlying class. These specializations exist for some standard types (like <code>String^</code>)
    and can be generated for LINQ to SQL database mappings. If the template specialization isn't available you have to 
    use common methods that can be used for invoking method (or property) by its name. </p>
    
  <h3>Typed wrappers</h3>
  <p>Using class if the corresponding template specialization exists is fairly simple. The following example declares expression working with the 
    <code>String^</code> type:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// 'String^' variable
Expr&lt;String^&gt; name = Var&lt;String^&gt;("name");

// Expression that uses 'IndexOf' and 'Substring' methods
Expr&lt;String^&gt; sh("Hello Tomas");
Expr&lt;int&gt; n = sh.IndexOf('T');
Lambda&lt;Func&lt;String^, String^&gt;^&gt;^ foo = 
  clq::fun(name, sh.Substring(0, n) + name);

// Print LINQ representation and execute
Console::WriteLine(foo-&gt;ToLinq());
Console::WriteLine(foo-&gt;Compile()("world!"));
</pre>
  <p>In this example we used two methods that are declared in the <code>Expr&lt;String^&gt;</code> class. These methods were 
    <code>IndexOf</code> and <code>Substring</code> and they represent calls to according methods of the <code>String^</code>
    type. If you look at the program output, you can see that it contains calls to these two methods (there is also a call to the
    <code>Concat</code> method which was generated by CLinq when we used <code>+</code> operator for string concatenation):</p>
<pre lang="text">
name => Concat(new [] {"Hello Tomas".
  Substring(0, "Hello Tomas".IndexOf(T)), name})
Hello world!</pre>  

  <h3>Indirect member access</h3>
  <p>To demonstrate the second approach, we'll first define new class with sample property, method and static method (you can also
    invoke static properties):</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// Sample class that we'll work with
ref class DemoClass
{
  int _number;
public:
  DemoClass(int n) { 
    _number = n; 
  }  
  // Property
  property int Number {
    int get() { return _number;  }
  }
  // Standard method
  int AddNumber(int n) {
    return _number = _number + n;
  }
  // Static method
  static int Square(int number) {
    return number * number;
  }
};
</pre>
<p>Now let's get to the more interesting part of the example. We will first declare variable of type <code>DemoClass^</code> and
  later we'll use the <code>Prop</code> method to read property by its name, <code>Invoke</code> to call member method and 
  <code>InvokeStatic</code> to invoke static method of this class (the <code>AddNumber</code> method could be a bit tricky,
  because it increments number stored in the class as a side-effect, which means that the value of expression depends on the
  order in which members of the expression are evaluated):</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// Construct the lambda expression
Expr&lt;DemoClass^&gt; var = Var&lt;DemoClass^&gt;("var");
Lambda&lt;Func&lt;DemoClass^,int&gt;^&gt;^ foo = clq::fun(var, 
  var.Prop&lt;int&gt;("Number") + 
  var.Invoke&lt;int&gt;("AddNumber", Expr&lt;int&gt;(6)) + 
  Expr&lt;DemoClass^&gt;::InvokeStatic&lt;int&gt;("Square", Expr&lt;int&gt;(100) ) );

// Compile the lambda and pass instance of 'DemoClass' as a parameter
DemoClass^ dcs = gcnew DemoClass(15);
int ret = foo-&gt;Compile()(dcs);

Console::WriteLine("{0}\n{1}", foo-&gt;ToLinq(), ret);
</pre>  
  <p>And the output of this example will be:</p>
<pre lang="text">
var => Add(Add(var.Number, var.AddNumber(6)), Square(100))
10036
</pre>
  <p>I included the output because I wanted to point out one interesting fact. You can see that there is no difference in the 
    output if you use generated template specialization or invoke by name. This is because if you're using invoke by name, the
    method (or property) that should be invoked is found using reflection before the LINQ expression tree is generated. This
    also means that if you execute the compiled lambda expression, it will call the method (or property) directly and not
    by its name.</p>

  <h3>Calling constructors in projection</h3>
  <p>So far we looked at calling methods and reading property values, but there is one more interesting problem that I didn't write
    about. Sometimes you may want to create an instance of a class and return it from lambda expression. CLinq doesn't support
    anything like C# 3.0 anonymous methods, but you can invoke class constructor and pass parameters to it using <code>clq::newobj</code>
    function. The following sample assumes that you have a class called <code>DemoCtor</code> with constructor taking <code>String^</code>
    and <code>int</code> as parameters:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// Arguments of the lambda expression
Expr&lt;String^&gt; svar = Var&lt;String^&gt;("s");
Expr&lt;int&gt; nvar = Var&lt;int&gt;("n");

DemoCtor^ d = clq::fun(svar, nvar, clq::newobj&lt;DemoCtor^&gt;(svar, nvar) )
  -&gt;Compile()("Hello world!", 42);
</pre>  
  <p>After executing this code, he <code>d</code> variable will contain instance of <code>DemoCtor</code> class created using
    constructor that I wrote about earlier. You should be very careful when using the <code>newobj</code> method, because there is
    no compile-time checking so if the required constructor doesn't exist or has incompatible types, the code will end with 
    run-time error.</p>

  <h2>Using LINQ</h2>
  <p>You're now familiar with all CLinq features that you need to start working with data using LINQ in C++/CLI! The key for working
    with data is the <code>CQuery</code> class which serves as a CLinq wrapper for the <code>IQueryable</code> interface, which
    represents query in LINQ. This class has several methods for constructing queries, including <code>Where</code>, <code>Select</code>,
    <code>Average</code> and other. You can construct this class if you already have an instance of class implementing the 
    <code>IQueryable</code> interface, but for working with database, you can use a tool to generate code which makes it simpler.
    <code>CQuery</code> class also has a property called <code>Query</code> that returns the underlying <code>IQueryable</code>
    interface - we'll need this property later for accessing the results of the query.</p>
    
  <h3>Working with SQL Database</h3>
  <h4>LINQ to SQL: Introduction</h4>
  <p>We will use two tools to generate CLinq header file with classes that will represent the database structure. 
    First tool is shipped as part of LINQ and is called <code>sqlmetal</code>. This tool can generate C# or VB.NET code,
    but it can also be used to generate XML description of the database structure. We will use the third option - the
    following example demonstrates how to generate XML description (<code>northwind.xml</code>) for database
    <code>northwind</code> at SQL server running at <code>localhost</code>:</p>
  <pre lang="text">sqlmetal /server:localhost /database:northwind /xml:northwind.xml</pre>
  <p>Once we have the XML file, we can use the <code>clinqgen</code> tool which is part of CLinq. This tool generates
    C++/CLI header file with classes that represent database tables, according <code>Expr&lt;&gt;</code> template specializations
    and also the class that will represent the entire database. You can customize the name and namespace of this class.
    If you want to automate this task, you can include the XML file generated by <code>sqlmetal</code> in your project and set 
    its custom build tool to the following command (Hacker note: You can also use pipe (<code>|</code>) to get these two 
    tools working together):</p>
  <pre lang="text">clinqgen /namespace:EeekSoft.CLinq.Demo 
  /class:NorthwindData /out:Northwind.h $(InputPath)</pre>  
  <p>Now you'll need to include the generated header file and we can start working with database. We'll first create
    instance of the generated <code>NorthwindData</code> class, which represents the database (note, that the example 
    uses <em>C++/CLI stack semantics</em>, but you can also use <em>gcnew</em> if you want instead). Once we have instance
    of this class, we can use it's properties that represent data tables. The properties with the <code>Q</code> prefix
    return the <code>CQuery</code> class, so we'll use these properties instead of properties without this prefix, which 
    are designed for using from C# 3.0 or VB.NET. The following example demonstrates some basic <code>CQuery</code> methods:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// Create database context
NorthwindData db(".. connection string ..");

// (1) Count employees
Console::WriteLine("Number of employees: {0}",
  db.QEmployees-&gt;Count());

// (2) Calculate average 'UnitPrice' value
Expr&lt;Products^&gt; p = Var&lt;Products^&gt;("p");
Nullable&lt;Decimal&gt; avgPrice = 
  db.QProducts-&gt;Average( clq::fun(p, p.UnitPrice) );
Console::WriteLine("Average unit price: {0}", avgPrice);

// (3) Get first employee whose 'ReportsTo' column is NULL
Expr&lt;Employees^&gt; e = Var&lt;Employees^&gt;("e");
Employees^ boss = db.QEmployees-&gt;
  Where( clq::fun(e, e.ReportsTo == nullptr) )-&gt;First();
Console::WriteLine("The boss: {0} {1}",
  boss-&gt;FirstName, boss-&gt;LastName);</pre>
  
  <p>In the first example we simply called the <code>Count</code> method which returns number of rows in the table. 
    In second example we use <code>Average</code> method which requires one argument, which is a lambda expression that
    returns some numeric type for every row in the table. Since <code>UnitPrice</code> column can contain <code>NULL</code>
    values we're working with <code>Nullable&lt;Decimal&gt;</code> type which can contain either real value
    or <code>NULL</code> which is represented using <code>nullptr</code> in C++/CLI. Third example uses <code>Where</code>
    method to filter only rows matching specified predicate (lambda expression). The result of this call is
    also <code>CQuery</code> class, so we can easily concatenate multiple operations. In this example we append call to the
    <code>First</code> method, which returns first row from the result set.</p>
  
  <h4>LINQ to SQL: Filtering &amp; projection</h4>
  <p>Let's look at the more interesting sample that cover filtering (<code>Where</code> method) and projection
    (<code>Select</code> method). The result of the query will be collection containing instances of custom class 
    called <code>CustomerInfo</code>, so let's first look at this class:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
ref class CustomerInfo
{
  String^ _id;
  String^ _name;

public:
  CustomerInfo([PropMap("ID")] String^ id, 
      [PropMap("Name")] String^ name) { 
    _id=id; _name=name; 
  }
  CustomerInfo() { }

  property String^ ID { 
    String^ get() { return _id; }
    void set(String^ value) { _id = value; }
  }

  property String^ Name {
    String^ get() { return _name; }
    void set(String^ value) { _name = value; }
  }
};</pre>  
  <p>The class has two properties (<code>ID</code> and <code>Name</code>), one parameter-less constructor and 
    one constructor that needs further explanation. The constructor takes two parameters, which are used
    to initialize both two fields of the class. There is also an attribute <code>PropMap</code> attached to 
    every parameter, which describes how does the constructor initialize the properties of the class (for
    example attribute <code>[PropMap("ID")]</code> attached to the <code>id</code> parameter means, that
    the value of <code>ID</code> property will be set to value of the <code>id</code> parameter in the constructor. </p>
    
  <p>Why is this information important? First, it will not be used in the following query, but you could write a query that 
    constructs collection of <code>CustomerInfo</code> objects and later filters this collection using the 
    <code>Where</code> method. The whole query will be passed to LINQ for conversion to SQL and if you use the
    <code>ID</code> property for the filtering, LINQ needs to know what the value that was assigned to this
    property earlier is. For this reason, CLinq has <code>PropMap</code> attribute which maps property values to 
    parameters passed to the constructor earlier. In C# 3.0 the behavior is a bit different, because you can use 
    anonymous types and you don't need to pass values directly to the constructor.</p>    
<pre lang="c++">
// DB context &amp; variable.. 
NorthwindData db(".. connection string ..");
Expr&lt;Customers^&gt; cvar = Var&lt;Customers^&gt;("c");

// Query: select some information about customers living
//   in country whose name starts with the letter "U"
CQuery&lt;CustomerInfo^&gt;^ q = db.QCustomers
  -&gt;Where(clq::fun(cvar, cvar.Country.IndexOf("U") == 0))
  -&gt;Select(clq::fun(cvar, clq::newobj&lt;CustomerInfo^&gt;(
      cvar.CustomerID, cvar.ContactName + 
      Expr&lt;String^&gt;(" from ") + cvar.Country)));

// Print SQL command sent to SQL server
Console::WriteLine("\nQuery:\n{0}\n\nResults:", 
  q-&gt;Query-&gt;ToString());

// Print returned rows
for each(CustomerInfo^ c in q-&gt;Query)
  Console::WriteLine(" * {0},  {1}", c-&gt;ID, c-&gt;Name);
</pre>  
  <p>This code is quite similar to the code that you usually write when working with LINQ in C# 3.0. 
    In this sample we first create the database context and declare variable that will be used in the query.
    The query itself takes <code>QCustomers</code> property (representing the Customers table in database),
    than filters (<code>Where</code> method) customers from country starting with the letter "U" and finally, 
    it performs projection (<code>Select</code> method) where it selects only information that we're
    interested in and creates the <code>CustomerInfo</code> object.</p>
  <p>The sample also prints the SQL command that will be generated from the query - LINQ returns the
    SQL command if you call the <code>ToString</code> method on the <code>IQueryable</code> representing the query.
    As I mentioned earlier, the underlying <code>IQueryable</code> of the <code>CQuery</code> class can be 
    accessed using the <code>Query</code> property, so the code <code>q-&gt;Query-&gt;ToString()</code>
    returns the SQL command. The last thing that the code does is that it executes the query and prints information
    about all returned customers. The query is executed automatically when you start enumerating over the
    collection, which is done in the <code>for each</code> statement.</p>
  
  <h4>LINQ to SQL: Joins &amp; tuples</h4>
  <p>For the last example, I wrote very a more complex query. It first performs <code>GroupJoin</code> operation
    on customers and orders, which means that it returns collection of tuples containing the customer and 
    all her orders. After this join, it performs <code>Where</code> filtering and returns only customers
    who have at least one order that will be shipped to USA (the customers are still kept together with
    their orders). The last operation done by the query is projection where it generates string 
    with the name of company and number of orders associated with it.</p>
  
  <p>This query also demonstrates a few more interesting things that we didn't need earlier. 
    The example starts with two <code>typedef</code>s to make the code more readable. First just defines shortcut for the
    collection of orders, but the second uses the <code>Tuple</code> class, which is part of CLinq and I didn't 
    talk about it so far. <code>Tuple</code> is very simple generic class with two type parameters
    which contains two properties (called <code>First</code> and <code>Second</code>) that have the type
    determined by the type parameters. You can use this class if you want to return two different values
    from projection or join without declaring your own class. </p>
  <p>The query returns the <code>Tuple</code> type from the projection and later uses <code>Where</code>
    operation to filter the customers. This reveals one advantage of using the predefined <code>Tuple</code>
    class - the <code>co</code> variable whose type is the expression representing the tuple (<code>Expr&lt;Tuple&lt;&gt;^&gt;</code>) is 
    passed as a parameter to lambda expression and in the lambda expression we can directly use its properties
    (<code>First</code> and <code>Second</code>). Because we're manipulating with <strong>expressions</strong>, 
    we're not working with the <code>Tuple</code> class directly, but we're working with template specialization
    of the <code>Expr</code> class, in which the <code>Expr&lt;Tuple&lt;&gt;^&gt;</code> is expanded to 
    contain these two properties.</p>
  <p>I'll comment other interesting features used in this example later, so let's look at the query now:</p>
<pre lang="c++">
// First declare type for storing Customer and her Orders
typedef IEnumerable&lt;Orders^&gt; OrdersCollection;
typedef Tuple&lt;Customers^, OrdersCollection^&gt; CustomerOrders;

// Connect to DB and declare variables
NorthwindData db(".. connection string ..");
Expr&lt;Customers^&gt; c = Var&lt;Customers^&gt;("c");
Expr&lt;Orders^&gt; o = Var&lt;Orders^&gt;("o");
Expr&lt;OrdersCollection^&gt; orders
  = Var&lt;OrdersCollection^&gt;("orders");
Expr&lt;CustomerOrders^&gt; co = Var&lt;CustomerOrders^&gt;("co");

// The Query
CQuery&lt;String^&gt;^ q = db.QCustomers
  // Group customers and their orders and 
  // produce collection of 'CustomerOrders'
  -&gt;GroupJoin(db.QOrders,
    clq::fun(c, c.CustomerID),
    clq::fun(o, o.CustomerID),
    clq::fun&lt;Customers^, OrdersCollection^, CustomerOrders^&gt;
      ( c, orders, clq::newobj&lt;CustomerOrders^&gt;(c, orders) ))
  // Filter only customers with order shipped to USA 
  // Note: 'Second' is the collection with orders
  -&gt;Where( clq::fun(co, co.Second.Where( 
      clq::fun(o, o.ShipCountry == "USA" )).Count() &gt; 0) )
  // Projection - string concatenation
  -&gt;Select( clq::fun(co, co.First.CompanyName + Expr&lt;String^&gt;(", #orders = ") + 
      Expr&lt;Convert^&gt;::ToString(co.Second.Count()) ) );</pre>
			
  <p>Let's focus on the <code>Where</code> clause. The lambda expression accepts expression of type <code>Tuple</code>,
    which I explained earlier, as a parameter and it accesses its second value (<code>co.Second</code>). Type
    of this parameter is expression representing collection (<code>Expr&lt;IEnumerable&lt;&gt;^&gt;</code>) -
    this is another specialization of the <code>Expr&lt;&gt;</code> class and you can discover using the InteliSense that 
    this class has a lot of methods for working with collections! These methods correspond to the methods
    available in the <code>CQuery</code> class, but are designed for working with expressions representing queries, instead
    of working with queries directly. In this example we use the <code>Where</code> method, which returns expression
    representing query again and also the <code>Count</code> method.</p>
  <p>Second class that wasn't mentioned earlier is <code>Expr&lt;Convert&gt;</code>, which is just another template
    specialization similar to the <code>Expr&lt;Math&gt;</code> that contains several methods for type conversions. In this 
    example we use the <code>ToString</code> method for converting number of orders to string.</p>
  
  <h2>Project summary</h2>
  <p>Currently, the project is in very early phase, which means it needs more testing and also review from other people.
