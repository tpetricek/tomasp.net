<p>Similarly to the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-autumn-2011.aspx">last year</a>,
  I already have a number of F# events planned for the end of the summer and autumn that 
  I'd like to invite you to!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/08/VS2012-Live">Visual Studio 2012 has been completed</a>
  recently and it comes with F# 3.0. For me, this means two things. Firstly, it is the second
  Visual Studio version of F#, which means that functional programming is worth taking seriously.
  Secondly, F# 3.0 comes with <em>type providers</em>, which is a killer feature for working with
  data. No matter if you're a C# programmer now to functional programming or if you're an F#
  user in the real-world, I hope you can find some interesting and useful event below!
</p>

<p>The two main things that I'm going to be involved in are SkilsMatter trainings in London and New York
  and a few events at the biggest functional conference (ICFP) in Copenhagen...</p>

<h2>Trainings in London and New York</h2>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/autumn-2011-talks/sm.gif" class="rdecor" />
<p>Over the last year, we started doing F# trainings with <a href="http://trelford.com/blog/">Phil 
  Trelford</a> in <strong>London</strong>. After the successful <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/2012-progressive-f-tutorials-nyc">Progressive F#</a> 
  conference (perfectly organized by <a href="http://richardminerich.com/2012/06/nyc-progressive-f-tutorials-2012-in-retrospect/">SkillsMatter and Rick Minerich</a>),
  we also decided to offer the trainings in <strong>New York</strong>. After doing the trainings
  for a year, we gained some useful experience and we're constantly updating the materials, so
  now should be the best time to sign up!</p>

  <p style="text-align:left;">If you already experimented with F# and want to use
    it in production, this is the course for you. You'll learn about the sweet spots
    for F# such as concurrent programming, data access and analysis and others. </p>

  <h3 style="margin:0px 0px 15px 0px;"><a href="http://functional-programming.net/courses/functional-dotnet">Functional Programming in C# and F#</a></h3>
  <p style="text-align:left;">Learning about functional programming makes you a better programmer, regardless
    of the language you use. In this course, you'll learn about functional ideas
    and you'll leave with working F# knowledge.</p>

<h2>Functional programming in Copenhagen</h2>

<p>I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-academia.aspx">already mentioned</a> events that are
  going to take place as part of International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) in 
  Copenhagen between <strong>9th and 15th September</strong>. Anil Madhavapeddy wrote a 
  <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2012/07/31/the-functional-week.html">comprehensive ICFP guide</a>
  (definitely take a look!), so I will focus only on the events related to F#.</p>

<p>The most important information is: The event is not just for academics! In fact, quite the
  opposite. There is a number of events (including my F# tutorial) that are designed for people
  who do not know any functional programming yet!</p>

<div style="float:right;width:49%">
  <h3 style="margin:0px 0px 15px 0px;"><a href="http://www.lexifi.com/ml2012/">ML Workshop</a> and <a href="http://cufp.org/conference/sessions/2012/cufp-talks">CUFP Talks</a></h3>
  <p style="text-align:left;">Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) is a conference
    where people share their (technical and non-technical) experience with using functional
    programming in practice, so it is a great place to learn how functional programming solves real-world problems. I'll be also talking about F# type providers at ML workshop, which is more academically oriented, but very interesting event!</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://cufp.org/conference/sessions/2012/cufp-talks">CUFP talks</a> on <strong>15 September</strong></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.lexifi.com/ml2012/">ML workshop talks</a> on <strong>13 September</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div style="margin-right:52%">
  <h3 style="margin:0px 0px 15px 0px;"><a href="http://cufp.org/conference/sessions/2012/functional-concepts-real-world-f-tomas-petricek-un">F# Tutorial at CUFP</a></h3>
  <p style="text-align:left;">This is a one-day F# tutorial designed for people with no prior
    functional experience. In the morning, we'll start by looking at functional ideas (using C# and F#
    to explore them). In the afternoon, we move to using functional programming in practice for data 
    processing using F# 3.0 in Visual Studio 2012. You'll also learn about the latest F#
    features...</p>
