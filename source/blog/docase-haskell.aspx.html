 - description: The blog post presents a paper that extends Haskell with pattern matching on monadic values. The paper has been accepted for publication at Haskell Symposium 2011 and extends the idea of joinads that I previously created for F#. The paper provides deeper theoretical background and discusses Haskell implementation.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The paper doesn't discuss the implementation of the Haskell language extension and the samples
  in details, so I'll add a few additional information to this blog post. At the moment, the 
  extension is implemented using a simple pre-processor that translates Haskell'98 with the
  <code>docase</code> extension into pure Haskell'98. The pre-processor is based on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/arrowp" type="external">Ross Paterson's
  pre-processor</a> for the arrow notation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.Joinads">Github repository</a> contains the following directories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Preprocessor</strong> directory contains the implementation of the pre-processor. It
can be compiled using the <code>Makefile</code> provided and then executed using 
the command: <code>joinadsp.exe Sample.jhs &gt; Sample.hs</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samples</strong> includes numerous examples that use joinads. It includes <code>Joinad</code> instance
for the <code>Maybe</code> type and types mentioned in the paper (parsers that can be used for
input validation, parallelsim monad used above and simple cooperative parallelism 
monad using resumptions).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ParMonad</strong> includes core parts of the <code>Par</code> monad that is used in the parallel programming
samples. The implementation is extended to support speculative parallelism (see a separate
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/speculative-par-monad.aspx">a blog post</a>). a complete modified implementation is available in a <a href="http://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.ParMonad">separate
project</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensions</strong> shows several examples that use <em>generalized monad comprehensions</em> 
to write similar examples as those that use <code>docase</code> notation. <em>Parallel monad comprehensions</em> 
are a generalization of <em>parallel list comprehensions</em> and overlap with joinads in an interesting way.
