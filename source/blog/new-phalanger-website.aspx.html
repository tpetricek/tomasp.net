<p>As you may know, I became new project lead for the <a href="http://php-compiler.net/">Phalanger project</a>
  [<a href="http://php-compiler.net/" target="_blank">^</a>]. Phalanger was started as a project at Charles 
  University (where I'm studying) by Tomas Matousek, Ladislav Prosek and 4 other guys, the first version was
  very successful and they started wokring on the second version which introduces PHP in the family of first-class 
  .NET languages (which makes it fully interoperable with the rest of .NET world). After releasing the second 
  version, Tomas and Ladislav moved to Microsoft and convinced me to continue in the Phalanger development.
  Most of the work on the 2.0 version was already done, so we're currently working on implementing the 
  rest of the PHP/CLR language extensions, making Phalanger more compatible with existing PHP apps and so on.
  For more information about the history of Phalanger visit the <a href="http://www.php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=core%3ahistory">project history page</a>
  [<a href="http://www.php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=core%3ahistory" target="_blank">^</a>].</p>
  
<p>I think that Phalanger is in the phase when it can be very interesting for both PHP and .NET communities, 
  but it never got greater publicity and there are not very much examples and articles to demonstrate
  the interesting Phalanger features. To improve this we started working on the new Phalanger website where
  users could share their experiences, tips etc. We used PHP wiki called <a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki">DokuWiki</a> [<a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki" target="_blank">^</a>] (running, of course on Phalanger)
  and you can find the new website here:</p>

    [<a href="http://www.php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=user-wiki" target="_blank">^</a>] (you can edit pages in user wiki after logging in)</li>
</ul> 
<p>I also wrote two articles about Phalanger (and I'm working on more :-)) to explain the most important
  and interesting Phalanger features and concepts. You can find the articles at our web:</p>

</ul>  
<p>I'll also continue blogging about Phalanger, so you can expect more information about Phalanger, problems that we're 
  currently solving as well as some other tips, tricks in this blog. If you're interested only in Phalanger you can use
