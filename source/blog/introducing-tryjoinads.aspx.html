<p>If you have been following my blog, you've probably already heard of <em>joinads</em>. It is
a research extension of F# computation expressions (or monads in Haskell). The extension
makes computation expressions more useful in domains like parallel, concurrent and reactive
programming. However, it can be used for any type of computation including, for example, parsers.
If you're interested in detailed description, you can find it in two academic papers that
I blogged about previously: <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">PADL 2011</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/docase-haskell.aspx">Haskell 2011</a>.</p>

<p>The extension adds a keyword <code>match!</code> - as the syntax suggests, it is akin to pattern
matching using <code>match</code>, but instead of pattern matching on values, you can pattern match
on computations like <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code> (or on other monadic values). Just like other features of
computation expressions, the <code>match!</code> syntax is translated to applications of several
methods defined by the computation builder.</p>

<p>I won't say more about joinads in this post, because you can now easily try joinads yourself...</p>

<h2>Try it at TryJoinads.org</h2>

<p>I won't say more about joinads in this post, because you can now easily try joinads yourself!
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-variations-joinads.aspx">Previously</a>, the only option was to use a prototype F# compiler from command line.
However, a recent <a href="http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/">open-source release of F#</a> also includes the source code of a 
Silverlight-based F# compiler and a control used at <a href="http://www.tryfsharp.org">TryFsharp.org</a>.</p>

<p>This inspired me to create a web site where you could play with the <code>match!</code> extension in 
your web browser. The web site runs a modified version of the F# compiler and contains 
tutorials that demonstrate several applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Experiment with joinads in F# at: <a href="http://tryjoinads.org">TryJoinads.org</a></li>
</ul>

<p>At the moment, the web site contains only a few tutorials, but I'll keep adding more
as I publish them on this blog. To whet your appetite, the following list shows applications
that I'm working on (and that I'll publish on the blog in the next few days).</p>

<h3>TryJoinads Tutorials</h3>

     title="Various applications of the match! syntax" />

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-prog.aspx"><strong>TryJoinads (I.): Asynchronous programming</strong></a>
shows how to use joinads to asynchronously wait for multiple computations or
to wait for the first computation that produces a certain value.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinad-tasks.aspx"><strong>TryJoinads (II.): Task-based parallelism</strong></a>
shows how to use joinads for parallel programming using the .NET <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type.
An example implements recursive tree processing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-agents.aspx"><strong>TryJoinads (III.): Agent-based programming</strong></a>
demonstrates how to simplify your F# agents with joinads (the <code>MailboxProcessor&lt;'T&gt;</code> type)
and avoid the (ugly) <code>Scan</code> method when waiting for certain messages.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-join-calculus.aspx"><strong>TryJoinads (IV.): Programming with joins</strong></a>
shows a library that uses joinads to embed <em>join calculus</em> in F#.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-options.aspx">TryJoinads (V.): Implementing the option joinad</a></strong>
explains the joinad operations by implementing a simple computation builder
for the <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code> type.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-parsing.aspx">TryJoinads (VI.): Parsing with joinads</a></strong>
shows how to implement simple parser combinators that support the <code>match!</code> notation.
Joinads capture intersection of languages and a choice without back-tracking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TryJoinads (VII.): Implementing asynchronous builder</strong>
explains how to implement joinad operations for F# asynchronous workflows (<code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code> type)
and how the <em>aliasing</em> operation works.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Source code &amp; contributions</h2>

<p>One of my motivations for working on <a href="http://tryjoinads.org">TryJoinads.org</a> was to 
make it possible for others to experiment with the extension. The above list of possible
uses for <code>match!</code> is definitely not complete and I believe there are numerous other
interesting computation expressions that could use the feature.</p>

<p>Using the Silverlight-hosted F# compiler, you can write your own joinads. To make
it possible to easily share your experiments, I published the entire source code of
the <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/TryJoinads">TryJoinads.org project on GitHub</a>. 
If you implement your own computation expression that uses joinads, I'd be more than
happy to include it as one of the tutorials. You can find more information about
contributing on the GitHub page of the project.</p>
