<p>When writing F# programs, I often write some nice code snippet or some useful helper
  function that I'd like to share with the F# community. Unfortunately, my blog posts are
  usually longer and more elaborate, so I never get to blogging about it. Now that I have a 
  twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">follow me if you don't already</a>)
  I thought I could just post the snippet somewhere, but there was no 
  good web site for posting F# snippets - until now! </p>

<ul>
  <li>If you can't wait any further, then go directly to the new F# snippets web site at
  	<a href="http://fssnip.net">fssnip.net</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The web site uses my earlier project <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebsnippets-intro.aspx">F# Web Snippets</a> to format F# source
  code. It highlights colors and adds JavaScript tooltips using services provided by the
  F# compiler, which means that you'll get almost the same experience as when reading code
  in Visual Studio. I also wanted to make the page a repository of browsable snippets, so you can use
  it in two ways...</p>

<h2>Introducing F# Snippets</h2>
<p>The web site uses my earlier project <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebsnippets-intro.aspx">F# Web Snippets</a> to format F# source
  code. It highlights colors and adds JavaScript tooltips using services provided by the
  F# compiler, which means that you'll get almost the same experience as when reading code
  in Visual Studio. I also wanted to make the page a repository of browsable snippets, so you can use
  it in two ways:</p>
<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Add public snippet</strong> - If you have any F# snippet that could be generally useful,
    you can send it as a <em>public snippet</em>. This means that the snippet will be listed on
    the web site and will be findable using search engines. You'll be asked to add some additional
    information such as brief description, your name or nickname and a few tags, so that the
    snippet can be categorized.</li>
  <li><strong>Private snippets</strong> - If you need to share some F# code at Twitter, 
    get a nicely formatted version of code for your blog posts or attach a snippet with 
    proper colorization and tooltips to you answer or question in some forums, you can 
    post it as a <em>private snippet</em>. In this case, it won't be linked from the web 
    site (and you won't have to enter description, your name or tags). You'll still get a nice
    short URL that you can use to link to your snippet (but you'll have to remember it).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Website features</h2>
<p>When inserting an F# snippet, the web site runs a compiler on the 
  server, which is relatively slow (so please be patient when posting snippets). Unlike 
  for example <a href="http://pastebin.com">pastebin.com</a> or similar pages for posting
  snippets, the web site targets only F#, but it provides some unique F# features.</p>
<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Colorization &amp; Tool tips</strong> The colorization uses F# tokenizer
    (meaning that it handles some advanced aspects like nested comments). It also uses
    F# type-checker to get tool tips with type information about all identifiers and 
    generates nice JavaScript tool tips.</li>
  <li><strong>Versioning &amp; passcode</strong> If you post a snippet, it is possible
    to update it later. If you want, you can enter a passcode, so that only you can update
    the snippet (don't use secure password). The history of source code is stored (but
    changes in comments and tags are not tracked)</li>
  <li><strong>Listing &amp; tags</strong> Public items have author and a list of tags
    and they are listed by the name and by tags, so you can easily browse snippets. This
    currently looks like a good way of finding items (together with search engines that
    will hopefully start indexing the web now that I posted a public link!)</li>
</ul>

<p>The web site is still evolving and I expect to improve it as it becomes more popular. 
  I'll do changes that will look important based on how the web site is used, so feel 
  free to use it and it will adapt to work well :-). One of the first plans is to 
  automatically export all snippets to some source control, so that they are archived
  in some independent place...</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Thanks to Robert Pickering, Antonio Cisternino and James Margetson, the web site 
  already contains a few useful F# snippets in addition to those that I submitted during
  the development. I think that with your help, the web site can become really useful resource
  of reusable snippets that solve some of the common problems that F# developers often 
  need to solve. If you ever find yourself thinking that some snippet you just wrote
  is interesting and could be useful or if you write something when explaining F# to your
  colleagues, then please go on and post it to the web site! I'm sure I'll do that - 
  I started working on the web site when I got irresistible feeling to 
  share <a href="http://fssnip.net/E">this snippet</a>.</p>
