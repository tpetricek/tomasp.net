<p>About a week ago, I attended the F# in Education workshop in Boston. It was a great event
  with many interesting people around. I believe that the workshop was very exciting for everyone who is
  interested in F#, but uses Mac or Linux. The F# team recently made some effort to improve the
  F# support on Mono (meaning mainly Mac and Linux). The recent <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/10/november-2010-f-2-0-free-tools-update.aspx" type="external">November 2010 CTP update</a>
  contains several bugfixes that make it possible to use F# on Mono 2.8. Another great thing 
  that happened at the workshop is the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx" type="external">open source release of F#</a>
  (see also <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Nov-11.html" type="external">blog post</a> by Miguel with a post-check-in photo).
  At the workshop, I also announced my contribution to the cross-platform F# story, a project that 
  I've been working on recently - <strong>the F# language binding
  for MonoDevelop.</strong>

</div>
<p>I promised to make it available as soon as possible after the workshop. As usually, things take
  longer, than one would like, but I'm finally ready to announce the initial (beta) version of the 
  plugin. The screenshot on the right shows some of the features of the F# language binding. As you
  can see, there is an F# Interactive tool window, syntax highlighting as well as IntelliSense 
  auto-completion.</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying it out, here are links to the repository (you can use
  it to install the language binding from the MonoDevelop Add-ins manager) and source
  code. The F# plugin needs to be able to locate F# installation and it also requires 
  more F# assemblies to be installed in the GAC, so you may as well want to read the instructions
  before trying it :-).</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><a href="http://functional-variations.net/monodevelop/" type="external">Project homepage</a> at the Functional Variations 
    web site has more information about the project as well as detailed installation instructions.</li>
  <li>I also created a web page that contains information about <a href="http://functional-variations.net/crossplatform/" type="external">installing
    F# on Mac and Linux</a> which explains how to install F#, such that the MonoDevelop plugin can

    variable to F# installation location)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to see some interesting uses of the F# MonoDevelop plugin, you can also watch 
  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/fsharpined/videos.aspx" type="external">my 
  talk at the F# in Education event</a>. In one demo, I used F# on Mac to play with a simple, composable
  functional 3D library. In another example I demonstrated how to asynchronously process stock 
  prices on Linux. The last demo, showing my <code>match!</code> extension didn't work all that well, because
  I had too many virtual machines running, but I'll blog about <code>match!</code> again sooner or later!</p>

<p>In addition to the F# plugin for MonoDevelop itself, I'd also like to mention two web sites that
  I've been working on and some interesting cross-platform F# screencasts...</p>

<h2>Cross-platform F# screencasts</h2>
<p>To show how working with F# feels on other platforms, I created two screencasts. You can find them
  in the <a href="http://functional-variations.net/screencasts/" type="external">screencasts section</a>
  on the Functional Variations web site (I'll add all future screencasts there). The first screencast is
  quite basic and it shows the installation of F# and command line version of F# Interactive and compiler.
  The second screencast is more exciting. It shows how the F# plugin for MonoDevelop works in two common
  scenarios...</p>

<h3><a href="http://functional-variations.net/screencasts/linux-commands.aspx">Installing and using F# command line tools on Linux</a></h3>

<div style="margin-right:220px">
<p>This screencast shows how to start using F# on Linux. It demonstrates:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to install F# on Linux from a ZIP file available at <a href="http://www.fsharp.net">fsharp.net</a></li>
<li>How to install additional scripts and tools from <a href="http://fsxplat.codeplex.com">F# cross-platform samples and packages</a></li>
<li>Working with command line tools distributed as part of F#</li>
<li>Using F# Interactive to create and evolve a simple Gtk# user interface</li>
<li>Writing an application Gtk# and compiling it from command line</li>
</ul>

<li>Creating and compiling standalone F# projects and using Windows Forms libraries in MonoDevelop</li>
<li>The screencast also demonstrates IntelliSense features provided by the addin, such as identifier completion, tool tips and background parsing and type-checking.</li>

<h2>Functional Variations and Functional Teaching</h2>
<p>As you probably noticed, most of the cross-platform materials, screencasts and the F# MonoDevelop
  plugin are hosted at <a href="http://functional-variations.net">Functional Variations</a> web site.
  This is another project that I was working on recently. The main purpose of the web site is to 
  provide a home for various academic and cross-platform materials related to F#. Said simply, the 
  web page should be a home for everything that's related to F# and doesn't quite fit to the 
  official <a href="http://fsharp.net">Visual F# Development Centre</a>, which is focused mostly on
  professional developers.</p>

<p>The web site currently has two sections related to academic uses of F# and two sections related 
  to using F# in cross-platform environment:</p>
<ul class="spaces">
  <li><a href="http://functional-teaching.net/" type="external"><strong>Functional Teaching</strong></a> is a 
    section dedicated to teaching F# language at universities, using F# to teach functional 
    programming concepts and similar. It also has links to several F# videos. </li>
  <li><a href="http://functional-variations.net/" type="external"><strong>Functional Variations</strong></a> is a 
    section dedicated to academic research related to F#. Currently, it lists some academic publications
    and projects that are either about F# or use F#. In the future, I'd like to provide more
    information about the F# open source release and how to use it for creating various research projects.</li>
  <li><a href="http://functional-variations.net/crossplatform" type="external"><strong>CrossPlatform F#</strong></a> 
    contains information about installing and using F# on Linux and Mac. In the future, this should
    also include some information (or links) about the open source F# release.</li>
  <li><a href="http://functional-variations.net/monodevelop" type="external"><strong>F# for MonoDevelop</strong></a> 
    is the home for the F# MonoDevelop plugin. Currently, it contains installation instructions, but
    I'd also like to add some information for those who are interested in contributing to the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>The web site uses a simple wiki based on the <a href="http://www.hamishgraham.net/page/Downloads.aspx/ASP.NET-Wiki-Control-with-Markdown">ASP.NET wiki control
  with Markdown</a> and is quite easy to edit. However, it can be edited only by registered users. 
  To prevent spammers from attacking the web site (and random people on the internet from posting 
  nonsense there), there is (currently) no public registration. However, I'll be very happy to create
  a user account to anyone from the F# community who would be interested in contributing to the web 
  site (either by adding relevant links or by writing some new material). Finally, if you have some
  materials that could be linked from any of the web pages (e.g. on your blog or somewhere else), 
  <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">let me know</a>!</p>
  
<p> The web site is a bit "beta"
  version, but I'm in touch with people from the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/about/default.aspx" type="external">Microsoft External Research</a>,
  who seem to be quite interested in taking the web sites to a "next level", so stay tuned...</p>
