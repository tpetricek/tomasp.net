<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Before looking at the source code, I'd like to explain how the animation works, because it uses one very simple
  trick. Even though it looks, that the precision of the model is increased every time the camera turns up or down
  when flying through the fractal, the shape isn't actually changing. The effect is achieved by the fact that the position
  of camera changes when turning up or down and the view starts again from a location before the whole cube.
  This means that the model is not changing and we only need to do a loop of camera animation to get the feeling of 
  infinite movement through the fractal. The code that generates the fractal is written in F# (and I will shortly
  describe the key parts below) and the code to do the animation is declaratively specified in XAML.</p>
  
<h3>Generating the Fractal in F#</h3>  
<p>The first problem that we will look at is how to generate the fractal. As usually in 3D graphics we'll need to generate 
  a collection of triangles, but the code will first compose a fractal from small cubes and then turn them into triangles.
  There is also one optimization, which occurs when placing two cubes side-by-side. Obviously we don't
  want to include the sides that would be hidden, so this is handled in the code that composes the fractal and the code generates 
  reasonable number of triangles.</p>

<p>First, we'll define triangles from which the cube is composed. This needs to be done by hand and it is
  just a bunch of numbers, so you can look at the attached source code for the complete declaration. The type of this
  value is however interesting, so let's look at the type:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
// 3D point represented using integers
type pointi3d = int * int * int
// Triangle using integral points
type trianglei = pointi3d * pointi3d * pointi3d
// A value that represents a cube
val cube : ((int * int * int) * trianglei list) list
</pre>
<p>As we can see the cube is represented as a list of sides (so the length of the list will be 6) and for each side
  we have a tuple that represents the side (for example left side will have <code>(-1, 0, 0)</code>, bottom side will have 
  <code>(0, -1, 0)</code> etc.) and the side is represented as collection of triangles (we need two triangles for every 
  rectangular side). The cube represented by a <code>cube</code> value has size <code>1*1*1</code>. Now that we have a 
  cube, we also need a function that will return only the sides that we need:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Returns a cube with filtered sides
let GetCube incl_sides = 
  [ for (side,trigs) in cube 
      when Set.mem side incl_sides
      -&gt;&gt; trigs ]
</pre>
<p>The natural representation of needed sides is a set which contains tuples that represent the needed sides (which I
  mentioned earlier), so the type of <code>incl_sides</code> value is <code>Set&lt;int*int*int&gt;</code>. The function
  takes sides from the cube, filters those that should be included (because the side identifier is included in the set) and
  then returns all triangles from the side, so the result of the function will be simply a collection of triangles.</p>
<p>The next function is a function that we will call during every recursive step and that will call recursively
  our function for generating cubes and collect the generated triangles. Before looking at the function we need to 
  define the 'pattern' of the fractal. In the actual code, this is represented using 3D array (created using
  <code>Array3</code> module), but the values look like this:</p>
<pre>
The pattern representing the fractal:
  [ [1; 1; 1]; [1; 0; 1]; [1; 1; 1] ];
  [ [1; 0; 1]; [0; 0; 0]; [1; 0; 1] ];
  [ [1; 1; 1]; [1; 0; 1]; [1; 1; 1] ];
</pre>
<p>By the way, if you want to experiment a bit you can try changing the function that generates the pattern to return the opposite
  values, this means that it would return 1 instead of 0 and respectively - this generates another interesting
  fractal, but you would also have to change the animation as the existing one would 'fly' through the model.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the <code>PatternMap</code> function, which uses the pattern and calls a function
  given as an argument for every smaller cube generated using the pattern. When you look at the function 
  signature, you can see that the function takes a set of sides as an argument (this represents the sides
  of the whole cube that should be included) and a function that will be called recursively to generate
  the triangles. This function takes coordinates (x, y, z) of the smaller cube to generate and a set of
  sides that should be included for this smaller cube (this set depends on the pattern, but also on the
  argument specifying which sides should of the large cube should be included):</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">  
// Takes set representing included sides (around the cube) and calls 'f'
// for every sub-cube in the cube where pattern has '1', giving it  
// coordinates and set with sides to include in the cube.
//
// Type signature:
//   type side = int*int*int
//   Set&lt;side&gt; -&gt; (int*int*int -&gt; Set&lt;side&gt; -&gt; #seq&lt;'b&gt;) -&gt; list&lt;'b&gt;
let PatternMap incl_sides f =

  // Calculates set of sides to be included for specific location in the 
  // pattern. Uses 'incl_sides' for lookup when testing border sides and
  // uses the pattern for sides inside the pattern.
  let get_included_sides x y z = 
    Set.of_seq
      (seq 
        { // loop over all possible 'directions',
          // test if out of range and use either pattern or 'incl_sides'
          for idx, neq, (dx, dy, dz) in 
              [ (x, 0, (-1,0,0)); (y, 0, (0,-1,0)); (z, 0, (0,0,-1));
                (x, 2, ( 1,0,0)); (y, 2, (0, 1,0)); (z, 2, (0,0, 1)); ] do
            if ((idx &lt;&gt; neq &amp;&amp; pattern.[x+dx, y+dy, z+dz] = 0) ||
                (idx = neq  &amp;&amp; Set.mem (dx, dy, dz) incl_sides)) then yield (dx, dy, dz) })    
  
  // Recursively collect triangles from all the smaller 
  // cubes that should be included (as specifyied by the pattern).
  [ for x in [0 .. 2] do
      for y in [0 .. 2] do
        for z in [0 .. 2] do
          if (pattern.[x,y,z] = 1) then
            yield! f (x, y, z) (get_included_sides x y z) ]
</pre>
<p>The function contains one inner function (<code>get_included_sides</code>), which generates a 
  set with sides to be included for a smaller cube and the return value is generated by 
  sequence comprehension, which loops over all the elements (small cubes) in the pattern
  and calls the function given as an argument (<code>f</code>). The sequence comprehension
  returns using <code>yield!</code>, which means that it collects all the recursively generated 
  triangles and returns a list containing all of them.</p>

<p>As a last step we need to implement the recursive function that takes depth as an arguments and
  returns triangles using <code>GetCube</code> when the depth reaches some specified level, or calls
  <code>PatternMap</code> giving it a function that calls <code>Generate</code> recursively for 
  every generated cube. Note that the function also needs to move the recursively generated cubes 
  accordingly to the depth of the recursion:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
let rec Generate k incl_sides = 
  if k = 1 then 
    (GetCube incl_sides) 
  else
    let d = k/3
    PatternMap incl_sides ( fun (x, y, z) incl_sides -&gt; 
      (Generate d incl_sides) |&gt; translate (x*d, y*d, -z*d)  )
</pre>  
<p>And that's all - the rest of the code that I didn't comment here mostly deals with conversion
  of the generated triangles (which contained coordinates in the edges) to the format required by
  WPF (triangles contain just indices to some array with edges), but that's not very interesting. 
  The second part that I didn't mention is calling the WPF functionality, but as F# is .NET language
  this is very straightforward, so this is commented only in the complete source code, which you can find below.  
  You can also look at a good introduction to this topic in an article that
  discusses using WPF 3D from F# written by Robert Pickering [<a href="#wpffractref">2</a>].</p>

<h3>Animating the Camera in WPF</h3>  
<p>Now let's look at the second part of the application, in which we'll use XAML (which is a declarative 
  language based on XML, which is used for defining user interface and some basic interactions including animations
  in WPF). We'll need to declare a <code>Storyboard</code>, which is an object that describes an animation. 
  Our storyboard will first perform an animation that moves the camera from the initial position (which is far from
  the fractal) closer to the object and then we'll use <code>ParallelTimeline</code> object, which can 
  contain an animation that is executed forever. In this repeated animation we start moving the camera from a position 
  right before the fractal and move it into the fractal and we'll also change the <code>LookDirection</code> property
  of the camera when turning up or down (there are two distinct parts of the animation, first which moves the camera
  up and second which moves the camera down, but the following code sample includes only the first part, because the
  second is similar):</p>
<pre lang="xml">
&lt;Storyboard&gt;
  &lt;!-- First, move to the fractal --&gt;
  &lt;Point3DAnimation Storyboard.TargetName="cam" 
    Storyboard.TargetProperty="Position" Duration="0:0:4" 
    From="0,0,100" To="0,0,27" RepeatBehavior="1x"/&gt;
    
  &lt;!-- Repeat fractal animation forever --&gt;
  &lt;ParallelTimeline RepeatBehavior="Forever" BeginTime="0:0:4"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Move forward --&gt;
    &lt;Point3DAnimation Storyboard.TargetName="cam" 
      Storyboard.TargetProperty="Position" BeginTime="0:0:0"
      From="0,0,27" To="0,0,-9" Duration="0:0:4" RepeatBehavior="1x" /&gt;
    &lt;!-- Rotate camera up --&gt;
    &lt;Vector3DAnimation Storyboard.TargetName="cam" 
      Storyboard.TargetProperty="LookDirection" BeginTime="0:0:3"
      From="0, 0, -1" To="0, 1, 0" Duration="0:0:1" RepeatBehavior="1x" /&gt;
      
    &lt;!-- Move forward &amp; rotate camera down --&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;/ParallelTimeline&gt;
&lt;/Storyboard&gt;</pre>
<p>Animation of <code>Position</code> property is described using <code>Point3DAnimation</code>, which animates
  a property specified by <code>TargetProperty</code> from an initial value (<code>From</code>) to a target value (<code>To</code>)
  interpolating the coordinates of the 3D point linearly. The second animation primitive which I used in this
  example is <code>Vector3DAnimation</code>, which similarly animates a 3D vector, which specifies a direction in WPF.</p>
