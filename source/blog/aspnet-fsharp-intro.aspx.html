<p>CodeDOM (Code Document Object Model) is set of objects (located in <code>System.CodeDom</code> namespace) that can be used
    for representing logical structure of .NET source code. These classes are used for generating Web service references
    (using <code>wsdl.exe</code> tool), for generating typed datasets and in many other situations. The most interesting
    use of CodeDOM classes is in ASP.NET where ASP.NET generates code from <code>aspx</code>/<code>ascx</code> files and 
    compiles this code into web site assemblies (together with the code written in code behind files).</p>

  <p>This means, that you can use any language for developing ASP.NET web sites, as long as you implement CodeDOM provider
    that generates source code from CodeDOM structure and can compile these source files (this can be simply done by executing 
    command line compiler). 
I was recently working on CodeProvider for the F# language, and finally it supports everything
    what is needed by ASP.NET (however it is complete and it doesn't work for example with <code>wsdl.exe</code>). Using this
    CodeDOM provider you can write ENTIRE web site in F# (including in-line code enclosed in &lt;% ... source code ... %&gt;).
    I also created project template for F# web site that can be imported to Visual Studio 2005, so you can easilly try 
    writing web pages in F#...</p>

<h3>More recent article available</h3>
This article is no longer up-to-date. Although the techniques described in the article might still work (with a lot of adjustments to the newer version of F#), it is now recommended to use a different approach. Note that CodeDOM provider is now a part of F# Power Pack. For more recent information see:

  <h2>CodeDOM and providers</h2>
  <p>CodeDOM (Code Document Object Model) is set of objects (located in <code>System.CodeDom</code> namespace) that can be used
    for representing logical structure of .NET source code. For example you can use <code>CodeTypeDeclaration</code> class
    to represent class declaration or <code>CodeAssignStatement</code> to represent assignment in the body of method. CodeDom 
    is language independent and CodeDOM structure can be translated to source code in specified language using code generator 
    (class that implements <code>ICodeGenerator</code> namespace). The CodeDOM structure can be also compiled to assembly 
    using code compiler (implementation of <code>ICodeCompiler</code> interface). Microsoft provides several code providers 
    with .NET Framework (for C#, VB.Net, JScript and C++), but you can add your own by by implementing previously mentioned 
    interfaces.</p>
  <p>In the .NET Framework, CodeDOM is used for automatic code generation. For example when you add web reference to 
    your project, the wrapper class that calls web service is generated using CodeDom. Some more examples are
    typed dataset (generated from XSD files) and generator for data layer in the upcoming LINQ project,
    but the most interesting use for CodeDOM for me is in ASP.NET 2.0. </p>
  <p>Typical ASP.NET web page consists of several <code>aspx</code>/<code>ascx</code> files and associated code behind files 
    written in one of the .NET languages. When building web page, ASP.NET uses CodeDOM for building <code>aspx</code>/<code>ascx</code>
    files. It parses these files and generates according CodeDOM structure. For example <code>&lt;asp:Button id="btn" runat="server" /&gt;</code> 
    declaration is translated to declaration of <code>btn</code> member and code that assigns new instance of
    <code>Button</code> object to this member. This generated structure is compiled to .NET assemblies using code compiler
    and the web page is ready to use. If you use any in-line code in ASP.NET page, it is included in the 
    CodeDOM structure as literal, which means that if the generated CodeDOM is compiled using C# code compiler,
    it can contain literals only in C# language (because you can't mix languages in one source file).</p>
  
  <h2>ASP.NET and F#</h2>
  <p>In ASP.NET 1.1 you could compile code behind files using different compiler than the rest of the page 
    (source generated from <code>aspx</code>/<code>ascx</code>). This method is used by ASP.NET in F# demo by 
    Robert Pickering [<a href="#aspfsintrol">1</a>]. The more complex approach that is available in ASP.NET 2 is
    to write <code>CodeDomProvider</code> implementation for F#. This makes it possible to write F# in-line code
    in web pages and this method allows you to fully benefit of ASP.NET compilation model (for example you can
    use Publish Web Site command in Visual Studio).
    </p>
  
  <h3>FSharpCodeProvider &amp; AspNetFsharpCodeProvider</h3>
  <p>I wanted to implement CodeDomProvider for the F# language, for the reasons mentioned above. Currently, I'm 
    presenting version of provider that is able to compile ASP.NET pages quite well, however I implemented only features 
    required by ASP.NET, so the provider is not complete. There are also some problems that has to be handled
    specially (for example, F# doesn't support partial classes), so apart from standard provider (<code>FsharpCodeProvider</code>),
    I also implemented <code>AspNetFsharpCodeProvider</code> that contains several 'hacks' for ASP.NET.</p>
  
  <h3>How to use it?</h3>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> For correct functionality of F# CodeDOM compiler, you have to modify your
    system variable PATH to include 'bin' directory of your F# installation folder. This is because, code compiler
    uses <code>fsc.exe</code> for compilation and there is no simple way for finding where the F# is installed. </p>
  <p>The most simple way to start creating ASP.NET web sites in F# is to use VS.NET project template that you can 
    find in the downloads section. Using this template, you can create web page that is already configured
    to use F# language. After installation, select <i>File</i> - <i>New</i> - <i>WebSite..</i> and in the dialog select language 
    'Visual C#' (it is not possible to add another language AFAIK) and than select 'F# WebSite' template.</p>
  <p>If you want to configure ASP.NET web site to use F# code provider manually, you have to do the following steps. 
    First modify the <code>web.config</code> file to include the following elements in the <code>compilation</code> section:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;system.web&gt;
    &lt;compilation debug="true"&gt;
      &lt;compilers&gt;
        &lt;compiler language="F#;f#;fs;fsharp" extension=".fs" 
          type="EeekSoft.FSharp.CodeDom.AspNetFSharpCodeProvider, fscodeprovider"/&gt;
      &lt;/compilers&gt;
    &lt;/compilation&gt;
  &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>
  <p>This adds reference to the assembly that contains the 
    <code>AspNetFShaprCodeProvider</code> class and it configures ASP.NET to use F# code generator for <code>aspx</code> 
    files which <code>Language</code> attribute is set to "F#". When this is done, you can add F# page by adding
    <code>aspx</code> and code behind <code>fs</code> files. In the <code>Page</code> directive, set the 
    <code>Language</code> attribute to "F#" and define the code behind class in the <code>fs</code> file.</p>
  <p>The following example shows code behind class for simple web page (that contains one button with ID set 
    to <code>btnOk</code>):</p>
<pre>
namespace FSharpWeb

open System;;
open System.Web.UI.WebControls;;

<span class="c">// Code behind class declaration</span>
type Default = class inherit System.Web.UI.Page as base
  <span class="c">// Declaration of button control</span>
  val mutable btnOk : Button;
  <span class="c">// All fields must be initialized in constructor</span>
  new() = { btnOk = null; }
  <span class="c">// Set text of button in onload</span>
  override this.OnLoad (e) =
    btnOk.Text &lt;- "Hello world!";
    base.OnLoad (e);
end;;
</pre>  
  <p>There is still one little difference when compared with C#, which is that it is required to
    manually declare all controls (with ID) that are on the page (<code>btnOk</code> in this example). 
    This is because F# doesn't (currently) support partial classes and so the partial class with
    control declarations that is generated by ASP.NET is dropped by the CodeDOM provider. The rest is
    very similar to how you develop ASP.NET pages in other languages; you can see more examples if you 
    download attached example application. More information regarding object oriented programming in F# 
    can be found in F# manual available at F# homepage [<a href="#aspfsintrol">3</a>]. </p>
  
  <h2>Other CodeDom provider notes</h2>
  <p>As I mentioned earlier, the CodeDOM generator I created is still very limited and it is tested
    only with ASP.NET. You can find list of not implemented features in the release notes (see downloads).
    In the future, I'd like to extend it to support generating code for accessing web services too
    (code is generated using <code>wsdl</code> tool). If you have any interesting idea, how it could be
    used or if you have any other comments, ideas, bug fixes, etc., please let me know (at 
    <a href="mailto:tomas@tomas.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>).</p>
