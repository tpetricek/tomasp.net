<p>I believe that the LINQ project and changes in C# 3.0 and VB 9 are interesting because they 
  allow rewriting of many ideas from functional programming. An ability to express queries easily
  is one of these ideas, but it is definitely not the only one. There are many other interesting ideas.
  The C# 3.0 language isn't primary a functional language, so it isn't easy to discover the idea
  if you use only C#, but it is possible to implement it if you know the idea already.</p>
<p>I already wrote a few interesting C# examples that were inspired by some functional idea.
  I'm a big fan of the F# language, so it is not a surprise that I started with an F# version
  of the problem and then looked at the way to do the same thing in C#. In particular, this is 
  how my article about building dynamic queries in C# came to the existence - the F# version used
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-flinq.aspx">FLINQ and Quotations</a> and then I demonstrated how to do the same in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx">C# 
  using expression trees</a>. Another example is my article about asynchronous 
  programming in C# <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx">using iterators</a>, which shows how to implement something 
  like F# <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/11/introducing-f-asynchronous-workflows.aspx">asynchronous workflows using iterators</a> in C# 2.0.</p>

<h3>Functional Reactive Programming</h3>  
<p>Today, I'm going to look at another very interesting idea from functional programming. It is 
  called <em>Functional Reactive Programming</em> and it comes from the Haskell community. You can find 
  a list of related <a href="http://www.haskell.org/frp/" type="external">Haskell projects here</a>.
  However, similar things (though they are not purely functional and simplified) are available 
  in the F# language as well. Don Syme introduced them in his blog post called

  available in F# and I'll extend it a little bit to allow some more interesting things. In the

<h3>Functional Reactive Programming</h3>  
<p>Today, I'm going to look at another very interesting idea from functional programming. It is 
  called <em>Functional Reactive Programming</em> and it comes from the Haskell community. You can find 
  a list of related <a href="http://www.haskell.org/frp/" type="external">Haskell projects here</a>.
  However, similar things (though they are not purely functional and somewhat simplified) are available 
  in the F# language as well. Don Syme introduced them in his blog post called 
  <em>"F# First Class Events: Simplicity and Compositionality in Imperative Reactive Programming"</em> 
  [<a href="#react1links">1</a>]. In this article, I'm going to briefly introduce the implementation
  available in F# and I'll extend it a little bit to allow some more interesting things. In the 
  second article from this series, I'll show how to implement the same thing in C# 3.0 (and in VB 9 too!)</p>  

<p>Actually this relation between functional programming in F# and C# is the key topic for my book 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-net-update.aspx">Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a>. 
  The book will discuss some of the topics that I'll introduce in this article in a larger detail. In this
  article I'll talk about events only, but the second important part of functional reactive programming
  is the use of continuous, time-varying values (such as the position of mouse or the time). In the book,
  this will be discussed as part of the Chapter 15 and events are the key topic for Chapter 16.</p>
  
<h2>Working with events in F#</h2>  
<img src="/articles/reactive/form_ellipse.png" alt="Form with an ellipse" style="float:right; margin:15px;"/>
<p>Let's briefly look at the features that are already available in the F# language and libraries. In F#,
  you can work with events as if they were ordinary objects (in functional terminology, we'd say <em>values</em>).
  This means that you can write a function that takes an event as an argument and returns an event. This 
  allows us to write various functions for processing events. We'll demonstrate this soon, but first let's 
  create some form that we can use for testing. The following example shows how to create a Windows Form 
  with a small green ellipse somewhere on the form. You can see the expected result in the attached screenshot.
  If you paste the source code to the F# interactive, a form should appear (Note, you can open the code in 
  Visual Studio, select it and hit <strong>Alt + Enter</strong> to run it in the F# interactive):</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
#light
open System.Drawing
open System.Windows.Forms

// Generate random location for the ellipse
let rnd = new System.Random()
let x, y = rnd.Next(550), rnd.Next(350)

// Create the main form
let frm = new Form(ClientSize=Size(600,400))
// Add event handler to paint the ellipse
frm.Paint.Add(fun e -&gt;
    e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.White, 0, 0, 600, 400)
    e.Graphics.FillEllipse(Brushes.DarkOliveGreen, x, y, 50, 50)  
  )
frm.Show()
</pre>
<p>Nothing very exciting so far; n this example we used events in the traditional way. This means 
  that we used the <code>Add</code> method to attach a handler to the event and we specified the 
  event handler in a lambda function (which is just like anonymous delegate in C# 2.0 or function in C# 3.0).
  This is the usual way for attaching handlers to events in C# too, with the difference that you use 
  built-in <code>+=</code> operator.</p>

<h3>Processing event streams</h3>
<p>Now, let's finally take a look at the F# way of processing events. We'll extend the example to
  display some message when a user clicks on the ellipse. Traditionally, you'd write an event handler
  that would get <code>MouseEventArgs</code> as an argument. It would test whether the position 
  of the cursor is inside the ellipse and then show the message.
  However, there is another way we can think about events. You can imagine that event such as
  <code>MouseDown</code> is a stream of information about the clicks. Once you click on the form,
  new information appears in the stream and we can process it. When we think of events in this way,
  we can see that events (or <em>event streams</em>) are very similar to lists or other collections.
  This means that we can use techniques for working with collections for processing events. </p>
<p>I already wrote about functions for working with lists in F# in my F# overview [<a href="#react1links">6</a>], but 
  very briefly - you can use functions like <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> for working with 
  lists. The first one returns a list with elements for which a given predicate is true. The second one
  uses the given function to transform an element (for example a number <code>n</code>) into something
  else (for example a type that contains the original number and its square). Let's take a look at an example
  that demonstrates this:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
> [1 .. 10]
    |&gt; List.filter (fun n -&gt; n % 2 = 1)
    |&gt; List.map (fun n -&gt; (n, n*n));;
val it : (int * int) list = [(1, 1); (3, 9); (5, 25); (7, 49); (9, 81)]
</pre>  
<p>In this example, we took a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Then we filtered it using <code>List.filter</code>, so
  the result contained only odd numbers. Finally, we used the <code>List.map</code> function to transform the 
  list into a list that contains a number and its square. We're using the pipeline operator (written as <code>|&gt;</code>)
  to sequence the operations. This simply means that the result of the operation on the left side will be 
  used as an argument for the next operation in the pipeline. You can see that the result printed by the F# interactive 
  contains squares of all odd numbers in that range.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why I am talking about lists here, when I promised an article about events. The answer is
  that functions like this make perfect sense for working with events as well. We can use <code>filter</code> to
  ignore events that are not interesting for us (such as when the user clicks outside of the ellipse) and we 
  can use <code>map</code> to turn information about the click into something more interesting, such as
  a message that we'll show to the user. Let's finally implement the code that handles clicks on the ellipse 
  using these event processing functions:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; // Utility function to calculate the distance 
  open System
  let dist (x1, y1) (x2, y2) =
    Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(x1 - x2, 2.0) + Math.Pow(y1 - y2, 2.0))
  ;;
val dist : float * float -> float * float -> float

&gt; let evtMessages =
    frm.MouseDown
      |&gt; Event.filter (fun mi -&gt; 
          // The distance between click location and 
          // the center of the ellipse is less than 25
          dist (float mi.X, float mi.Y) (float(x + 25), float(y + 25)) &lt; 25.0 )
      |&gt; Event.map (fun mi -&gt;
          // Return message that we'll show to the user
          if (int (mi.Button &amp;&amp;&amp; MouseButtons.Left) &lt;&gt; 0) then "Left button"
          elif (int (mi.Button &amp;&amp;&amp; MouseButtons.Right) &lt;&gt; 0) then "Right button"
          else "Some trick!")
  ;;
val evtMessages : IEvent&lt;string&gt;
</pre>  
<p>We aren't yet done with the application, but we did two important steps. Let's take a look at them in detail.
  We first used the <code>Event.filter</code> processing function. The predicate that we gave it tests whether
  the center of the ellipse <code>(x + 25, y + 25)</code> is close enough to the location of the mouse click.
  The <code>mi</code> value represents <code>MouseEventArgs</code>, so the location of the click is stored 
  in <code>(mi.X, mi.Y)</code>. The next processing function we're using is <code>Event.map</code>. This 
  takes the information about the click and returns some string depending on the button that was used.</p>

<img src="/articles/reactive/form_clicked.png" alt="Clicked on the ellipse" style="float:right; margin:15px;"/>
<p>I entered the code to the F# interactive, so that we can see what the result is. As you can see, this 
  creates a value called <code>evtMessages</code> that has a type <code>IEvent&lt;string&gt;</code>. This 
  is the F# representation of events. This means that the result is an event that will be raised when the 
  user clicks on the ellipse. The values carried by the event will be of type string. The only thing that 
  we need to do now is to add handler for the event and display the message in the message box. Our goal
  is to get something like the message in the screenshot on the right side.</p>  

<h3>Reacting to events</h3>
<p>The <code>evtMessages</code> value is an ordinary event, so we could use its <code>Add</code> method
  just like we used <code>Add</code> method of the <code>frm.Paint</code> event earlier. However, F# 
  gives us more ways to do this and it's a good idea to use the same approach that we used in the previous
  listing to filter the event stream.</p>
<p>We need to do two things - first, we'll need to add some additional text to the message and second, 
  we want to display the message box. This can be written using two primitives. You know the first one already - 
  we'll use <code>Event.map</code> to turn the event stream with simple messages into a stream that
  contains messages that we actually want to show to the user. In the next step, we'll use <code>Event.listen</code>.
  This is a processing function that simply calls a function we give it when the event is raised and doesn't 
  do anything else. This means that it ends our event processing code and returns <code>unit</code>, which is 
  just like <code>void</code> in C#. We'll use two more functional tricks - partial function application and 
  function composition. These are in detail explained in my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-net-update.aspx">F# book</a>,
  but you can get some idea from the F# overview [<a href="#react1links">5</a>] that I wrote some time ago. </p>  
  
<pre lang="fsharp">
evtMessages
  |&gt; Event.map (sprintf "Hey, you clicked on the ellipse.\nUsing: %s")
  |&gt; Event.listen (MessageBox.Show &gt;&gt; ignore)
</pre>
<p>This time we'll writing processing code for the <code>evtMessages</code> value, which is an event that
  we constructed in the previous example. In the first line, we use the <code>Event.map</code> function to 
  format the message. We use the <code>sprintf</code> function and give it a format string that specifies 
  that the function should expect a string as an argument. This means that the type of the expression in parentheses
  will be a function that takes a string and returns a string. This is compatible with what <code>Event.map</code>
  expects - it is a function. We used partial application, which means that we omitted the last argument and 
  used the expression as a function value.
</p>
<p>The second line uses <code>Event.listen</code> to show the message box. As other functions for processing
  events, this one also expects a function as an argument. The function will get string as an argument and 
  shouldn't return anything, because <code>Event.listen</code> terminates the event processing. In the example,
  we use function composition operator (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>) to create a function that will take a string, 
  call <code>MessageBox.Show</code> and then <code>ignore</code> the value returned by the <code>MessageBox.Show</code>
  (we have to add <code>ignore</code>, because <code>MessageBox.Show</code> returns a <code>DialogResult</code>
  and <code>Event.listen</code> expects that nothing will be returned).</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we've looked at an example that demonstrates the idea behind reactive programming and 
  working with events as values in F#. I haven't discussed all the details - there are many other operations
  such as <code>Event.map</code> and <code>Event.filter</code> that you can use to combine event processing
  code in different ways (and these are indeed discussed in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-net-update.aspx">my book</a>). 
  In the next part of this mini-series, we're going to look how to implement the same ideas in C#. 
  I'll also introduce my project, which is an implementation of LINQ query operators for events that I call 
  <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>.</p>
