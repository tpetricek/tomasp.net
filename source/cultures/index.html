    <p class="lead">What defines a correct program? What education makes a good programmer? The answers to these questions depend on whether programs are seen as mathematical entities, engineered socio-technical systems or media for assisting human thought.</p>
    <p class="lead">Cultures of Programming shows how programming concepts and methodologies emerged and developed from the 1940s to the present and interprets key historical moments as interactions between five different cultures of programming.</p>

    <h2 class="sub"><a href="exhibition/">Exhibition in Galerie Chodba</a></h2>
    <h3 class="h2sub">Faculty of Mathematics and Physics</h3>
    <p class="lead">
      The exhibition tells the key ideas from the book through the visual medium.
      In the first part of the exhibition, we look at the basic believes of the five different 
      cultures of programming&mdash;mathematical culture, hacker culture, engineering culture, 
      managerial culture and humanistic culture.</p>
    <p class="lead">
      In the second part, we illustrate how cultures exchanged ideas on program&shy;ming languages, 
      types and object-oriented programming and how they disagreed about the nature of the 
      discipline and questions of beauty and art.
    </p>
    <h4>Virtual Exhibition</h4>

    <h3 class="h2sub">Past and Upcoming Appearances</h3>

    <p class="lead">I have been working on the book for quite a few years and have talked about the 
      project in a number of places over time. You can find some of the talks and interviews below.
      There are also a few upcoming appearances and I'm always looking forward to more!</p>

    <h4>Upcoming Appearances</h4>
    <p>I'm always happy to talk about history of programming at conferences or in podcasts! 
      There is a lot to talk about, from interactions between cultures to histories of programming 
      languages, types, object-orientated programming or the neglected hacker and humanistic 
      ideals of programming. Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>!</p>
