      This exhibition looks at the history of programming through the perspective 
      introduced in the <a href="../">Cultures of Programming</a> book. In 14 posters, the 
      exhibition illustrates the five different basic ways of thinking about programming and 
      documents a number of remarkable collaborations and disagreements between the five cultures.

    <h3 class="h2sub">A New Look at the History</h3>


    <p class="lead">
      This exhibition tells the story of how interactions and disagreements between 
      the different cultures of programming shaped programming concepts and methodologies that 
      programmers use today, including programming lang&shy;uages, types and objects, software engineering 
      and interactive programming. It follows the evolution of these concepts and methodologies from 
      the early days of programming to recent times and interprets the key developments in terms of 
      interactions between cultures of programming. The interpretation reveals two interesting 
      aspects of the development of programming. </p>
    <p class="lead">
      First, many programming innovations happen when multiple cultures meet and contribute to a single 
      concept or a methodology. Second, individual cultures of programming retain a remarkably strong 
      identity throughout the history, marking programming as an inherently pluralistic discipline. 
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      The opening panel introduces the exhibition and the book. It tells the key premise of the 
      exhibition&mdash;looking at the history of programming as interactions between five different
      cultures of programming. The exhibition follows a different structure than the book,
      dedicating a panel to each of the individual cultures, before focusing on a few selected 
      interactions between cultures.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      The <strong>Cultures of Programming</strong> panel illustrates the five different cultures
      of programming with one paradigmatic example for each culture. For <em>managerial culture</em>,
      the large scale of systems is a typical trait, whereas creative ideas on education are often
      linked to the <em>humanistic culture</em>. Using a chalk and a blackboard for reasoning about
      programs characterises the <em>mathematical culture</em>, while the <em>engineering culture</em>
      sees programming as a complex task requiring professionalism. Finally, the <em>hacker culture</em>
      tends to push the limits of what is possible, not always with serious goals in mind.</p>

    <p class="large">
      There are many excellent books on the history and philosophy of programming and computing.
      The panel <strong>History and Philosophy</strong> shows just a few of those. It includes a 
      number of books that defined some aspect of the field, technical accounts of specific aspect
      of the history of programming, as well as books that use the perspective of social studies to
      uncover how hidden biases, power structures and rhetoric reshape computing. My account in 
      Cultures of Programming aims to be more historical than a typical technical book and more
      technical than a typical historical book.

    <h2 class="sub">Five Cultures of Programming</h2>
    <h3 class="h2sub">Different Ways of Thinking about Programming</h3>

    <p class="lead">
      The first computer programmers came from a range of backgrounds including mathematics, electrical 
      engineering, business and psychology. Those disciplines shaped many of their basic assumptions 
      about programming, what kind of a task it is and how it should be done. Those different ways of 
      thinking about programming, that I refer to as cultures of programming, continue shaping program
      ming to this day. The cultures clash over basic principles, but also contribute to shared programming 
      concepts. Their basic assumptions remain at the core of current contentious debates about 
      programming.</p>
    <p class="lead">
      In the first part of the exhibition, we look at the basic believes 
      of the five different cultures of programming&mdash;mathematical culture, hacker culture, 
      engineering culture, managerial culture and humanistic culture.
    </p>


    <p class="large">
      The <strong>Mathematical culture</strong> sees programs as formal mathematical entities
      and believes that mathematical methods can tackle the increasing complexity of software 
      systems. The panel illustrates this way of thinking by highlighting two achievements of the
      culture. The Algol language, illustrated through a diagram describing its syntax, was 
      regarded as an "object of stunning beauty" and provided a common language for theoretical
      computer science. The mathematical focus played a key role in establishing computer science
      as an academic discipline within the modern university.</p>
    <p class="large">
      The panel gives a brief overview of the work of four computer science pioneers.
      John McCarthy first envisioned mathematical theory of programs; Peter Naur and 
      C. A. R. Hoare where the first to develop methods for formally proving properties
      of computer programs; while Peter Landin pioneered the use of the lambda calculus, 
      a formal system developed in the 1930s in the context of mathematical logic, as a model
      of programming languages. 
    </p>
    <p class="large">
      In contrast, the <strong>Hacker culture</strong> values direct engagement with the nitty-gritty
      details of program execution. The panel illustrates the values and practices of the 
      hacker culture. The Spacewar! game was a project born out of the desire to have fun with
      computers, but it was also a demonstration showing what can be achieved through ingenious 
      programming with the limited computing power of the 1960s. Hackers were also the first to 
      explore interactive ways of program&shy;ming, illustrated through the TX-0 computer, which was 
      installed at MIT and allowed programmers to directly engage with the machine, rather than
      submit their programs as batches of punched cards. The hacker culture also often distrusts
      existing structures and early computer hackers preferred to share their knowledge freely on 
      the ARPANET (predecessor of the Internet) rather than in established academic venues.
    </p>
    <p class="large">
      The <strong>Engineering culture</strong> sees programming as an applied engineering science.
      It recognizes programming as a challenging human activity and aims to build tools and 
      create practices to tackle the task. The panel illustrates some of the challenges of
      establishing the software engineering discipline and its narrative. Referring to failures
      as "bugs" suggested that they are small issues, easily dealt with, despite the astonishing
      cost of some of the software failures. One such challenging project was the development of
      anti-ballistic missile software systems throughout the Cold War period. The various software
      efforts helped the engineering culture establish its own language for understanding what 
      kind of software can be reliably built.
    </p>    
    <p class="large">
      The history of software engineering often centers around key moments including the 
      1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering and the meeting that led to the Agile Manifesto.
      These embody the ideals of the engineering culture, but they happen amidst a broader 
      and richer historical context.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p class="large">
      The <strong>Managerial culture</strong> originated in the military and business organizations.
      Their managers saw programming as a controlled production-like process. Programs should be 
      created according to specifications, with a predictable timeline and budget. The panel 
      illustrates the managerial efforts through two system examples. The Semi-Automated Ground
      Environment (SAGE) was a radar air-defence system built in the 1950s of an unprecedented
      complexity at the time. The IBM System/360 was a family of computer systems, alongside with a
      newly developed operating system, created by IBM in the 1960s. Both of these projects 
      posed a major challenge and prompted reflections on the managerial processes for building 
      software systems.</p>
    <p class="large">
      The panel illustrates the different processes for building software systems through the
      diagrams specifying the steps of the processes. First such diagram was created already in the
      mid-1950s as part of the SAGE project; widely known Waterfall development model described
      the development as a series of successive steps; while the Spiral development model proposed
      a process that repeats the basic four steps in a number of iterations.</p>

    <p class="large">
      The primary concern of the <strong>Humanistic culture</strong> is the human. This can take
      a wide range of forms and the panel illustrates the somewhat chaotic nature of the culture
      with the equally chaotic arrangement of some of its key ideas, concerns and projects. The 
      three illustrations in the panel exemplify three typical concerns.</p> 

    <p class="large">
      Alan Kay saw programming as a new medium that can convey the excitement of thought and
      creation. The kids exploring ideas with his imagined Dynabook in the panel illustrate the
      1970s vision of creating a personal computer for children of all ages.
      The 1980s Hypercard application for the Apple Macintosh is another example aiming to 
      enable knowledge sharing and was the spiritual predecessor of the World Wide Web.
      Finally, the humanistic culture has also often turned to art in order to prompt 
      critical reflections on the nature of computing, as well as human perception.

    <h2 class="sub">Origins of Programming Concepts</h2>
    <h3 class="h2sub">Collaborations and Struggles for Control</h3>

    <p class="lead">
      The first programmers in the 1940s were controlling the ENIAC computer by plugging cables
      to connect the individual components of the machine. Even after programming became a matter
      of specifying the program instructions on a punched card, programmers did not initially think 
      of the codes as a lang&shy;uage. Programming concepts familiar to programmers today,
      including that of a programming language, type or an object had to be invented.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    In the second part of the exhibition, we look how interactions between different cultures
    of programming gave rise to program&shy;ming languages, types and object-oriented programming,
    how the concepts evolved amidst disagreements between cultures and struggles for controlling
    the meaning of the concepts. The hypothesis put forward in Cultures of Programming is that
    the coexistence of multiple ways of thinking about programming enabled developments that would 
    perhaps not happen without this messy plurality.</p>

    <p class="large">In <strong>The invention of a programming language</strong>, we look at 
      how the concept of a programming language emerged as a stand-alone entity that can be studied
      independently of a specific computer or an implementation. Three of the illustrations in the
      panel represent the three cultures that made key contributions to the concept.</p>
    <p class="large">
      Throughout the 1950s, the hacker culture, illustrated by the first ENIAC programmers, 
      developed automatic coding systems that made it possible to control computers using 
      pseudo-codes not directly recognized by the machine. Those were interpreted or translated
      to actual machine instructions. At the same time, the linguistic metaphor became popular for
      thinking about programming and the mathematical culture adopted a theory of formal languages
      for describing the structure of a programming language. Last, but not least, the managerial
      culture had a practical need&mdash;to build programs that can be run on multiple different
      computers. The ideas from the three cultures combined to give rise to the idea of a 
      programming language, and the astonishing number of languages developed throughout the 
      1960s, as shown by the popular Tower of Babel illustration.
    </p>
    <p class="large">
      The <strong>Programming with types</strong> panel chronologically documents how the idea of
      type appeared in programming languages and how it was transformed by different cultures over
      time. Today, computer scientists link types in programming language to Bertrand Russell's
      work on types in the context of logic. Historically, the way types were adopted for
      programming was more roundabout.
    </p>
    <p class="large">
      There are multiple different origins for what would eventually be known as types in 
      programming. Modes in FORTRAN distinguished between fixed-point and floating-point numbers,
      but were a product of the hacker culture. Managerial culture, was more concerned with data 
      storage, as illustrated by an IBM COMTRAN data description card and the filing cabinet.
      Engineering culture adopted types as an abstraction mechanism&mdash;using type not to 
      describe the set of possible values, but to restrict what operations can be applied to a
      value.
    </p>
    <p class="large">
      The many different ideas on types coalesced in the ML programming language in the 1970s,
      which used types rooted in their mathematical description, both for modelling data and as
      an abstraction mechanism. But the unity did not last long. Mathematical culture developed
      a new more formal notion of types for interactive theorem proving, while the engineering
      culture adopted a pragmatic view on types, violating the formal assumptions of the 
      mathematical culture.
    </p>
    <p class="large">
      The history of <strong>Object-oriented programming</strong> illustrates another pattern
      of interactions between cultures, where the concept emerges in the context of one culture,
      but is then adopted and transformed by another culture. In case of object-oriented 
      programming, this happened multiple times.
    </p>
    <p class="large">
      The notion of an object first appeared in the Simula language, created in the 1960s
      for building programming simulations. Simula was rooted in the mathematical culture and 
      modelled the simulated world in terms of activities and processes, corresponding to later 
      classes and objects. In the 1970s, Smalltalk developed a humanistic perspective on
      object-oriented programming, viewing it as a flexible communication medium between the
      human and the machine. However, the practical virtues of object-oriented programming
      were recognized by engineers in the 1980s and even managers in the 1990s, who adopted
      it as a method for structuring large software systems and development teams, respectively.

    <h2 class="sub">Perspectives on Programming</h2>
    <h3 class="h2sub">Disagreements About the Basic Assumptions</h3>

    <p class="lead">
      The different ways of thinking about the nature of programming, represented by the five
      cultures, can contribute to shared technical concepts, but they also lead to basic 
      disagreements about the nature of programming, its limits and its methodologies.
      Debates about programming education, best ways of achieving program correctness and
      the possibility of formally verifying software are often rooted in such disagreements.   
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      In the final part of the exhibition, we look at three questions that illustrate the 
      disagreements&mdash;what is the problem of programming? what code is beautiful? and,
      how can programming be used to create art? The panels on beauty and art develop ideas
      that are only side-notes in the book, but that vividly reveal how the different 
      cultures think about programming.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      <strong>What is the problem of programming?</strong> The first panel in the series looks
      at the answers we get if we ask the proponents of the five different cultures a basic
      question about the nature of programming. Even though the work of many (if not the most) 
      figures in the history of programming spans multiple cultures of programming, the panel
      picks one illustrative quotation for each of the cultures.
    </p>
    

    <p class="large">The mathematical culture views programs as formal entities and is keen
      to point out that testing cannot prove the absence of bugs; only a formal proof can.
      The hacker culture views programming as a craft, requiring hands-on practice and personal
      knowledge. The engineering culture rejects both of these views and instead sees programming
      as an applied science, requiring rigorous practices. The managerial culture also seeks 
      rigorous methods, but sees programming primarily as the problem of people management,
      looking for ways of structuring teams and workloads. In contrast, the humanistic culture
      sees programming as a new kind of literacy or a tool for assisting human thought, 
      making the human its primary concern.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      If we ask the advocates of the different cultures <strong>What code is 
      beautiful?</strong> we get five very different answers. The answers illuminate the values 
      of the different cultures. For the hacker culture, beautiful code is code that cleverly
      uses the capabilities of the machine, even if that makes it difficult to understand for
      a human. This is the case of the inverse square root function from the Quake III game.
      The mathematical culture applies the criteria of mathematical elegance. Beautiful
      code should achieve a lot by an elegant combination of small set of features. 
      This is a characteristic that many associate with the design of Algol 60.
      In contrast, the engineering culture values readability and understandability and
      appreciates well-structured code structure, like the one that became known as the
      Model-View-Controller design pattern.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      For the humanistic culture, the beauty of code lies in what it can communicate to the reader.
      This relies on the fact that code expresses meaning on two levels, first as instructions
      for the computer and, second, as text read by a human. Similar playfullness can be found
      in Václav Havel's poem shown in the panel&mdash;the meaning is hidden in the crossed-out
      line. Humanistic culture exploits the double coding in code poetry (as shown in the panel),
      but also, for example, in the design of esoteric programming languages. 
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      Finally, the panel on <strong>Programming and computer art</strong> compares three different
      ways in which programming has been used to create visual art and music.
      The work of computer art pioneer Frieder Nake in the 1960s was linked to the mathematical
      culture, in that it explored the artistic potential of algorithms to generate art, as
      in the black-and-white plotter print Homage to Paul Klee.</p> 
    <p class="large">
      With the rise of microcomputers
      in the 1970s, it became possible to use computers interactively to control music synthesis.
      This was explored by The League of Automatic Music Composers (later called The Hub), 
      who connected their computers in a pattern illustrated by the diagram. Each computer
      was responsible for some aspects of the generated music, but was also sending messages
      to all other computers in the network, who responded by changing the aspects they were
      controlling. In this setup, interesting patterns emerge as the result of the interaction, 
      but what emerges is not pre-scribed by a single given algorithm. </p>
    <p class="large">
      The move from a mathematical culture to the humanistic culture was completed with the
      emergence of live coding in the 2000s. The panel illustrates this with a photo from a 
      2023 Algorave performance in Netherlands. In live coding, the performer enters code live
      on stage and immediately executes it. The program is not a formal mathematical entity,
      but a living and evolving object. Live coders often start and end with empty file.

      subtle background that is, in some way, representative of the topic presented
      in the panel. The images in the panel are photos from a range of archival sources,
