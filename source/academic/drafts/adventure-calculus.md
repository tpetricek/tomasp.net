Some of the most remarkable results in mathematics reveal connections between different
branches of the discipline. The aim of this paper is to point out a modest, but still
remarkable, similarity between a range of different interactive programming systems.
In many programming systems, the user can interactively construct a program by repeatedly
triggering some kind of completion mechanism and choosing one of the offered options. This
is the case with code editors for object-oriented languages (choosing object members), data
exploration environments (choosing an applicable transformation), but also theorem provers
(choosing an applicable tactic) and structure editors (choosing a grammar rule).

In this paper, we formally capture the essence of this interaction pattern through a small
formal model called _the choose-your-own-adventure calculus_. We show how a wide range
of different systems fits the model. Looking at the examples through a common perspective
reveals multiple subtle differences. To formally capture those, we characterise
basic properties of choose-your-own-adventure systems, resembling those from other areas
of programming language research, including correctness, completeness and uniqueness.
We further show how the choose-your-own-adventure calculus can be used as the basis for
formally studying more advanced interaction patterns including mixed-initiative interaction,
AI-based programming assistants and programming by demonstration.

We strongly believe that interaction with programming systems deserves as much attention
as the underlying programming languages. Our work is one step in this direction. It provides
a way of talking about commonalities and subtle differences between multiple interactive
programming systems and enables a transfer of ideas between interactive systems from very
different domains.
