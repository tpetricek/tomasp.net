For a long time, programming has been conceptualized as
the act of writing code. This view comes with a number of
assumptions. Code is written, compiled into an executable
and then used by a user who is distinct from the programmer
writing the code. Thinking about programming as
interacting with (or operating within) a substrate makes it
possible to rethink basic assumptions about programming.
