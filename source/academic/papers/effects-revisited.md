# Effect systems revisited - control-flow algebra and semantics

 - description:  This paper joins two recent developments related to effect systems - the development of richer
      effect systems based on complex algebraic structures and the development of semantic models based
      on monads. We show how _graded joinads_ link the two developments.

 Effect systems were originally conceived as an inference-based program analysis to
 capture program behaviour - as a set of (representations of) effects. Two orthogonal developments
 have since happened. First, motivated by static analysis, effects were generalised to values in an
 algebra, to better model control flow (e.g. for may/must analyses and concurrency). Second,
 motivated by semantic questions, the syntactic notion of set- (or semilattice-) based effect system
 was linked to the semantic notion of monads and more recently to graded monads which give a more
 precise semantic account of effects.

 We give a lightweight tutorial explanation of the concepts
 involved in these two threads and then unify them via the notion of an effect-directed semantics
 for a control-flow algebra of effects. For the case of effectful programming with sequencing,
 alternation and parallelism - illustrated with music - we identify a form of graded joinads as the
 appropriate structure for unifying effect analysis and semantics.
