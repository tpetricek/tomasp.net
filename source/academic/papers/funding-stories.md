In the context of open data, the analyst of that data is removed from the collection process.
This can make data analysis extremely difficult, even impossible if the data needed to answer
their questions has not been collected. We present a study aimed at exploring the difficulties
of open data analysis using, as an example, the data available on EU funding to the UK. We
report on some of the fundamental difficulties we observed whilst analysing this data and we
suggest that by building a catalog of such difficulties we can explain the limitations of
working with open data to the wider public and data publishers. Finally, we propose a
methodological transition in how data analysis is viewed as part of a wider process.
