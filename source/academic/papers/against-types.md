_What is the definition of 'type'_? Having a clear and precise answer to this 
question would avoid many misunderstandings and prevent meaningless discussions 
that arise from them. But having such clear and precise answer to this question 
would also hurt science, _"hamper the growth of knowledge"_ and _"deflect the 
course of investigation into narrow channels of things already understood"_.

In this essay, I argue that not everything we work with needs to be precisely 
defined. There are many definitions used by different communities, but none 
of them applies universally. A brief excursion into philosophy of science shows 
that this is not just tolerable, but necessary for progress. Philosophy also 
suggests how we can think about this imprecise notion of type.

## Watch the talk

As far as I know, the Onward! Essays talk has not been recorded, but I did a more recent talk 
about the topic of the paper at Lambda Days 2016 conference organized by 
<a href="https://vimeo.com/erlang">Erlang Solutions</a>. You can watch my
<a href="https://vimeo.com/160733435">History and Philosophy of types</a> talk below, or on Vimeo.
